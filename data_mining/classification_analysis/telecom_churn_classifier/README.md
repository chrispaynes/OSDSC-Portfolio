# Telecommunications Churn Prediction

### 1. Business Understanding

In the telecommunications industry, customer churn is a critical issue, defined as the percentage of customers who stop using a provider's product or service during a certain time frame. With annual churn rates potentially reaching 25%, and the cost of acquiring a new customer being ten times higher than retaining an existing one, customer retention is paramount. The primary business goal is to retain highly profitable customers by predicting which customers are at high risk of churn.

Since the telecommunications industry remains highly competitive and experiences high annual turnover rates, the goal is to use the KNN classification model to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. Additionally, this will spotlight which characteristics play a significant factor in customer churn. Once those customers and factors are identified, stakeholders can devise strategies to improve customer retention. This will ultimately allow the company to retain highly profitable and loyal customers.

As an analyst in a popular telecommunications company serving customers across the United States, your task is to analyze the dataset to explore data, identify trends, and compare key metrics to reduce customer churn.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage patterns, and historical churn data.
- **Data Description**: Key features include customer tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and service features such as internet service type, contract type, and payment method.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis includes understanding the distribution of churn rates, identifying patterns in customer behavior, and detecting any anomalies or outliers.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data where necessary.
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering to create new variables that may enhance model performance, such as interaction terms or aggregated metrics.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection**: Various predictive models are tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting.
- **Model Training**: Models are trained using the training dataset, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of model performance, including error analysis and validation against business objectives.
- **Limitations**: Consideration of any data limitations or assumptions that may impact the model's applicability or accuracy.

### 6. Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed as a service or integrated into a decision-support system for real-time predictions.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring of model performance and updates as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.

### Conclusion

The project aims to deliver a robust model for predicting customer churn, providing valuable insights for improving customer retention strategies and operational efficiency.
