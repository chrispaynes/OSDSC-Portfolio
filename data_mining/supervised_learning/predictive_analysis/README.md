# Predictive Analysis Project: Telecommunications Data Usage

### 1. Business Understanding

There are several key objectives for this data analysis at our telecommunications company. The primary goal is to use supervised learning to model a relationship between a customer's average annual data usage (target variable) and independent variables related to the customer's selected services and add-ons. This model will determine what — if any — relationship exists between the customer's elections and their data usage. Effectively, we'll determine if several explanatory variables can approximate a customer's data usage.

From a business perspective, the goal is to understand and predict our new and existing customer's expected data usage — to provide customers with an appropriate pricing tier and support for their bandwidth needs. As a telecommunications provider, this insight will help us optimize network resources, design more competitive data plans, and improve customer satisfaction. Lastly, if this model proves accurate, it will help our customer service representatives articulate factors impacting customer data usage and make personalized recommendations.

Can we mine the Telecommunications Churn dataset to accurately predict the average amount of data in Gigabytes (GB) a customer will use based on their selected services and add-ons? We'll test this by creating, evaluating, and refining an ElasticNet regression prediction model that will support our telecom company's strategic decision-making.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes features such as geographic information, demographic data, and service usage metrics.
- **Data Description**: Key features include `Zip`, `Population`, `Income`, `Outage_sec_perweek`, `Yearly_equip_failure`, `Tenure`, and `MonthlyCharge`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis includes understanding the distribution of key metrics, identifying trends, and detecting any anomalies or outliers.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data where necessary.
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering to create new variables that may enhance model performance, such as interaction terms or aggregated metrics.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection**: Various predictive models are tested, with a focus on ElasticNet regression for its ability to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.
- **Model Training**: Models are trained using the training dataset, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of model performance, including error analysis and validation against business objectives.
- **Limitations**: Consideration of any data limitations or assumptions that may impact the model's applicability or accuracy.

### 6. Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed as a service or integrated into a decision-support system for real-time predictions.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring of model performance and updates as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.

### Conclusion

The project aims to deliver a robust model for predicting customer data usage, providing valuable insights for improving our telecom company's service offerings, pricing tiers, and customer support strategies.
