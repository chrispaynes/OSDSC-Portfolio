### 1. Business Understanding

In the competitive telecommunications industry, understanding customer characteristics is crucial for long-term profitability. Gibson Telecom has received a high volume of customer complaints indicating that their services do not fit within lower-income customer budgets. The primary business goal is to segment customers based on their tenure and the percentage of their income spent on services and add-ons. This segmentation will enable Gibson Telecom to develop income-sensitive strategies and offers, ultimately improving customer retention and loyalty.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes customer data from Gibson Telecom, with features related to customer demographics, service usage, and financial metrics.
- **Data Description**: Key features include customer tenure, income, and the percentage of income spent on services and add-ons.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis includes understanding the distribution of customer tenure, income levels, and spending patterns on services.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data where necessary.
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering to create new variables such as the service-to-income ratio.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify the principal variables of customers.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Various clustering algorithms are tested, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, to segment customers based on the principal components.
- **Model Training**: Clustering models are trained using the training dataset to identify distinct customer segments.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluation of clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index to assess the quality of the clusters.
- **Business Evaluation**: Assessment of how well the identified customer segments align with business objectives and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

### 6. Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: The clustering model is deployed to segment customers in real-time, allowing for the implementation of targeted marketing strategies.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring of model performance and updates as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.

### Conclusion

The Gibson Telecom Customer Segmentation project successfully utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to identify key customer segments based on tenure and service-to-income ratio. The selected model provides a robust framework for developing income-sensitive strategies and offers, aimed at improving customer retention and loyalty. Despite the high volume of customer complaints, the project offers valuable insights into customer behavior and pricing alignment, helping Gibson Telecom remain competitive in the market.
