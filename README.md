# OSDSC Portfolio
Open Source Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my comprehensive data science portfolio! This repository houses a growing collection of personal data science projects, analyses, and explorations that demonstrate my skills and expertise in the field.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases various data science work including:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning models
- Data visualization projects
- Statistical analyses
- Real-world problem solving

I continuously add new projects and refine existing ones, making this an evolving representation of my professional journey and capabilities in data science. Feel free to explore the different directories to see specific projects and their documentation.

## Repository Architecture

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each top-level directory represents either:
  - An individual, self-contained data science project
  - A collection of related projects grouped by domain or technique

- Within each project directory, you'll typically find:
  - Source code and notebooks
  - Documentation explaining methodologies and findings
  - Data files or instructions for obtaining necessary datasets
  - Results and visualizations

This modular structure allows for easy navigation and exploration of specific areas of interest. Each project stands on its own with complete documentation and resources.
