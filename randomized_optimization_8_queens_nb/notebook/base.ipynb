    "In chess, a queen can attack any piece in the same row, column or diagonal. In the 8-Queens problem, given an 8 x 8 chessboard with only eight queens, place the queens on the board so that none of them can attack each other. There will be exactly one queen in each chessboard column. So determine the row position of each queen using a state vector. The bottom left corner of the chessboard is assumed to be in column 0 and row 0.\n",
