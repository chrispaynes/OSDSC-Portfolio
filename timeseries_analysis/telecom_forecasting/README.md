## Business Understanding

The latest U.S. economic forecasts, heightened interest rates, and negative public sentiment surrounding the global economy and a potential recession have caught the attention of many executive teams. At Goldfield & Banks, a telecommunications company, the leadership team typically relies on a 12-month forward-looking revenue forecast provided by the CFO. However, due to economic uncertainty, the leadership team seeks projections further into the future. The primary business goal is to provide revenue projections for the next 18 months using time series modeling techniques.

## Data Understanding
