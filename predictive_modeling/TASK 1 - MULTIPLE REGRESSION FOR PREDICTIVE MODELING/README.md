# Medical Charges Prediction Analysis

### 1. Business Understanding

#### Business Objectives

- Predict additional medical charges based on patient demographics and health conditions
- Understand key factors influencing medical charges
- Support healthcare cost planning and risk assessment

#### Business Success Criteria

- Development of a reliable prediction model for medical charges
- Identification of significant patient characteristics affecting costs
- Actionable insights for healthcare providers and insurers

#### Hypothesis

- Null Hypothesis (H0): Patient demographics and pre-existing health conditions do not influence additional medical charges
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Patient demographics and pre-existing health conditions influence additional medical charges

### 2. Data Understanding

#### Data Sources

- Medical Readmission dataset
- Contains patient demographics and health information
- Includes medical charges data

#### Initial Data Assessment

- Patient demographic features
- Pre-existing health conditions
- Medical charges (target variable)
- Data quality and completeness to be assessed

#### Data Exploration Goals

- Identify relationships between patient characteristics and charges
- Examine distribution of medical charges
- Detect potential patterns in health conditions vs costs

### 3. Data Preparation

#### Tasks

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering from health conditions
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Train-test split for model validation

#### Deliverables

- Clean, processed dataset
- Feature importance analysis
