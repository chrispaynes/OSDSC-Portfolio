# Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis

### 1. Business Understanding

#### Business Objectives

- Identify factors influencing hospital readmission rates
- Understand geographical impact on readmission likelihood
- Support targeted interventions in high-risk areas
- Optimize resource allocation across hospital chain

#### Business Success Criteria

- Development of reliable readmission prediction model
- Identification of high-risk geographical areas
- Actionable insights for hospital management
- Potential reduction in readmission rates

#### Hypothesis

- Null Hypothesis (H0): Area types do not influence hospital readmission rates
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Certain area types have significant impact on readmission likelihood

### 2. Data Understanding

#### Data Sources

- Hospital chain readmission dataset
- Patient demographic information
- Geographical/area type data
- Hospital location data
- Readmission status (target variable)

#### Initial Data Assessment

- Area type classifications
- Patient characteristics
- Hospital-specific factors
- Readmission outcomes
- Data quality and completeness evaluation

#### Data Exploration Goals
