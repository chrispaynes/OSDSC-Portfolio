# Airbnb Capstone Project

### 1. Business Understanding

The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data to predict additional charges associated with bookings. Understanding these charges can help hosts optimize their pricing strategies and provide guests with more transparent cost expectations.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of Airbnb listings, including features such as location, amenities, pricing, and reviews.
- **Data Description**: Key features include listing price, number of reviews, location, and additional charges.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis includes understanding the distribution of listing prices, identifying common amenities, and analyzing review sentiments.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize text data.
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering to create new variables such as average review score and amenity count.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection**: Various regression models are tested, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Model Training**: Models are trained using the training dataset, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Performance Analysis**: The selected model achieved a high R-squared value of 0.937, indicating a strong fit to the data.
- **Limitations**: Despite the high R-squared value, the analysis has limitations due to missing data on historical hospital visits, patient lifestyle, and health information. These factors could provide more actionable insights for reducing additional charges.

### 6. Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed as a web service or integrated into a pricing tool for Airbnb hosts.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring of model performance and updates as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.

### Conclusion

The project aims to deliver a robust model for predicting additional charges, providing valuable insights for hosts and guests. Despite data limitations, the model offers a strong foundation for further analysis and improvement.
