In linear algebra, a linear combination is a ==mathematical operation that involves scaling and adding vectors to create a new vector==. More formally, ==a linear combination of vectors is a sum of scalar multiples of those vectors.== This concept is fundamental to understanding vector spaces, transformations, and systems of linear equations.

A linear combination can be expressed as follows:

Given vectors **v_1, v_2, ..., v_n** and scalars **c_1, c_2, ..., c_n**, the linear combination of these vectors is:

**c_1 * v_1 + c_2 * v_2 + ... + c_n * v_n**

Here's what each part of the equation represents:

- **v_1, v_2, ..., v_n**: These are the vectors involved in the linear combination.
- **c_1, c_2, ..., c_n**: These are the scalar coefficients by which you multiply each vector.

==The result of a linear combination is a new vector. This operation can be performed in any vector space, not just in three-dimensional space.== It is a fundamental operation used in various contexts in linear algebra, such as:

1. ==**Span of Vectors**: The set of all possible linear combinations of a set of vectors forms a subspace known as the "span" of those vectors. The span represents all points that can be reached by linear combinations of the given vectors.==

2. ==**Vector Equations**: Linear combinations are used to represent vector equations, which are essential in solving systems of linear equations. A system of linear equations can often be expressed as a single vector equation involving linear combinations.==

3. ==**Basis**: In a vector space, a basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that can be used to express any vector in that space through linear combinations. The basis vectors represent the building blocks of the vector space.==

4. **Linear Transformations**: Linear transformations, which are often represented by matrices, involve applying linear combinations of vectors to create new vectors in the output space.

Linear combinations play a critical role in understanding the structure and properties of vector spaces, as well as in solving a wide range of mathematical and computational problems, particularly in the context of linear algebra and vector analysis.
