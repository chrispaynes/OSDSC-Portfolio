==Polar coordinates are a system of representing points in a plane using a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). In contrast to the Cartesian coordinates (x, y), where a point is identified by its horizontal and vertical distances from the origin, polar coordinates use the radial distance (r) and polar angle (θ) to specify the location of a point.==

The conversion between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, θ) is given by the following equations:

$x = r \cdot \cos(\theta)$
$y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)$

Conversely,

$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$

In polar coordinates:
- $r$ represents the distance from the pole to the point,
- $\theta$ represents the angle formed by the polar axis and the line connecting the pole to the point.

Polar coordinates are especially useful for describing circular and radial symmetry. Equations in polar form often have a more natural representation for problems involving circles, spirals, or other radially symmetric shapes. The polar coordinate system is widely used in calculus, physics, and engineering, particularly when dealing with problems that exhibit rotational or circular patterns.

In calculus, polar coordinates are often employed in the study of curves, areas, and integrals. The use of polar coordinates can simplify certain mathematical expressions and make it more convenient to describe and analyze problems with rotational symmetry.
