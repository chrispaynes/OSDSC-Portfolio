In linear algebra, a linear system refers to ==a set of linear equations involving one or more variables. These systems can be represented in matrix form, and their solutions often involve techniques such as Gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, or other methods. ==Here's a brief overview:

1. **Linear Equations:**
   - A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable raised to the power of 1. For example, $ax + by = c$ is a linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$.

2. **Linear System:**
   - A linear system consists of a set of linear equations with the same variables. Each equation represents a linear relationship among the variables. The general form of a linear system with $m$ equations and $n$ variables is:
$$
     \begin{align*}
     a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \ldots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1 \\
     a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \ldots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2 \\
     &\vdots \\
     a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m \\
     \end{align*}
$$
     Here, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the variables, and $a_{ij}$ and $b_i$ are constants.

3. **Matrix Form:**
   - The linear system can be compactly represented in matrix form as $Ax = b$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $x$ is the column vector of variables, and $b$ is the column vector of constants.

$$
     \begin{bmatrix}
     a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\
     a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
     a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix}
     x_1 \\
     x_2 \\
     \vdots \\
     x_n \\
     \end{bmatrix}
     =
     \begin{bmatrix}
     b_1 \\
     b_2 \\
     \vdots \\
     b_m \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

4. **Solutions:**
   - The goal of solving a linear system is to find values for the variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ that satisfy all the equations simultaneously. A solution to the system is a set of values for the variables that makes each equation true.

5. **Types of Linear Systems:**
   - A linear system can have unique solutions, no solutions (inconsistent), or infinitely many solutions. The number of solutions depends on the relationships among the equations and the constants.

Linear systems play a fundamental role in various areas, including physics, engineering, computer science, and economics. They are a central topic in linear algebra, and methods for solving them are essential tools in mathematical modeling and analysis.
