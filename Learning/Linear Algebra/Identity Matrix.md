In linear algebra, the identity matrix of size ${\displaystyle n}$ is the ${\displaystyle n\times n}$ square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It has unique properties, for example when the identity matrix represents a geometric transformation, the object remains unchanged by the transformation. In other contexts, it is analogous to multiplying by the number 1. 


The identity matrix is often denoted by ${\displaystyle I_{n}}$, or simply by ${\displaystyle I}$ if the size is immaterial or can be trivially determined by the context.

$${\displaystyle I_{1}={\begin{bmatrix}1\end{bmatrix}},\ I_{2}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}},\ I_{3}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}},\ \dots ,\ I_{n}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots &0\\0&1&0&\cdots &0\\0&0&1&\cdots &0\\\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\0&0&0&\cdots &1\end{bmatrix}}.}$$
