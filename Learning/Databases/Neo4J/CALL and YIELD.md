==In Cypher, the `CALL` clause is used to invoke a user-defined procedure or function, and the `YIELD` clause is used to return named values from a procedure or function. Together, they are often used to call and retrieve results from custom logic or predefined procedures. ==

Here's an explanation with examples:

### CALL Clause:
The `CALL` clause is used to invoke a procedure or function. Procedures and functions encapsulate reusable pieces of Cypher logic. They can be system-defined or user-defined.

#### Example - Call a User-Defined Procedure:
```cypher
CALL myProcedure(arg1, arg2) YIELD result
RETURN result;
```
==In this example, we are calling a user-defined procedure named `myProcedure` with arguments `arg1` and `arg2`. The `YIELD` clause is used to capture the results returned by the procedure, and we return those results in the `RETURN` clause.==

### YIELD Clause:
==The `YIELD` clause is used to expose named values from a procedure or function to the query scope. It allows you to specify which values should be returned and their names.==

#### Example - Yielding Values from a Procedure:
```cypher
CALL myProcedure(arg1, arg2) YIELD result1, result2
RETURN result1, result2;
```
In this example, the `myProcedure` is expected to yield two values named `result1` and `result2`. The `YIELD` clause captures these values, and the subsequent `RETURN` clause returns them to the query result.

### Combining CALL and YIELD:
You can combine the `CALL` and `YIELD` clauses to execute a procedure or function and retrieve specific results.

#### Example:
```cypher
CALL apoc.date.format(timestamp(), 'yyyy-MM-dd') YIELD value AS formattedDate
RETURN formattedDate;
```
In this example, we are using the APOC library to call a procedure that formats the current timestamp. The `YIELD` clause is used to name the result as `formattedDate`, and we return this formatted date.

These clauses are crucial for interacting with custom logic, functions, or procedures in Cypher queries, providing a way to modularize and reuse code.
