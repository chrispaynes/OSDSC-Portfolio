# Overview

OpenSearch (and Elasticsearch, from which OpenSearch is derived) supports various data types that allow you to define how data is stored, indexed, and searched within an index. These data types are specified in the index mappings. Here are some of the commonly used data types in OpenSearch:

1. **Text Data Type**: Text fields are used for full-text search. They are analyzed, tokenized, and suitable for searching through free-text data.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "text"
   }
   ```

2. **Keyword Data Type**: Keyword fields are not analyzed and are suitable for exact matching and filtering. They preserve the original text as-is.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "keyword"
   }
   ```

3. **Date Data Type**: Date fields are used for storing dates. They can be indexed in a way that allows date-based queries.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "date"
   }
   ```

4. **Numeric Data Types**: These include integer and floating-point numeric data types.

   - Integer:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "integer"
     }
     ```

   - Floating-Point:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "float"
     }
     ```

5. **Boolean Data Type**: Boolean fields store true or false values.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "boolean"
   }
   ```

6. **Object Data Type**: Object fields allow you to nest inner objects and fields within a document.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "object"
   }
   ```

7. **Nested Data Type**: Nested fields are used to store arrays of inner objects. They maintain the relationship between these inner objects.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "nested"
   }
   ```

8. **Ip Data Type**: Ip fields are used for storing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "ip"
   }
   ```

9. **Geo-point Data Type**: Geo-point fields store latitude and longitude coordinates.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "geo_point"
   }
   ```

10. **Binary Data Type**: Binary fields are used for storing binary data, such as images or files.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "binary"
   }
   ```

11. **Range Data Types**: Range data types are used for range fields, including integer_range, float_range, and date_range.

   - Integer Range:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "integer_range"
     }
     ```

   - Float Range:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "float_range"
     }
     ```

   - Date Range:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "date_range"
     }
     ```

These data types are used to define the structure and characteristics of fields within an index. The choice of data type depends on the nature of the data you are indexing and your specific search and analysis requirements.
# Keyword vs Text
In OpenSearch (and Elasticsearch, upon which OpenSearch is based), both "keyword" and "text" are data types used to define how text fields are analyzed and indexed. These data types are essential for controlling how text data is stored and searched in the search engine. Here's the key difference between the two:

1. **Keyword Data Type**:
   - ==**Purpose**: The "keyword" data type is typically used for fields that should not be analyzed. It's used for exact matching and filtering.==
   - **Indexing**: Fields defined as "keyword" are stored as-is in the index, and no analysis is performed on the text.
   - **Example**: It's suitable for fields like product IDs, URLs, usernames, or any data where you want to maintain the exact, original value for searching and filtering.
   - **Use Case**: Best suited for fields where you don't want text to be tokenized or analyzed, preserving the text exactly as entered.

2. **Text Data Type**:
   - ==**Purpose**: The "text" data type is used for fields that should be analyzed and tokenized. It's used for full-text search.==
   - **Indexing**: Fields defined as "text" are analyzed, and text is broken into terms (tokens) for efficient searching. Analysis may include lowercasing, stemming, and removing stopwords.
   - **Example**: It's appropriate for fields like product descriptions, articles, comments, or any free-text data where you want to enable full-text search capabilities.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for fields where you want to search for text content and perform operations like stemming (e.g., searching for "running" matches "run") or removing common words that don't impact search quality.

Here's a simplified example of how you might define these data types in an OpenSearch index mapping:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "exact_field": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "full_text_field": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, "exact_field" is defined as a "keyword" data type, preserving the exact values, while "full_text_field" is defined as a "text" data type, enabling full-text search capabilities.

The choice between "keyword" and "text" data types depends on your specific use case and whether you need exact matching or full-text search. It's also important to consider the trade-offs between storage space, search performance, and the specific text analysis requirements for your application.
