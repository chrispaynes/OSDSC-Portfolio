The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is t==he product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. ==

Mathematically, it is defined as:

$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

By convention, $0!$ is defined to be 1.

The factorial function has several use-cases in mathematics and other fields:

1. **Combinatorics:**
   - ==Factorials are extensively used in combinatorics to count the number of ways elements can be arranged or selected.== For example, the number of permutations of $n$ distinct items is $n!$.

2. **Binomial Coefficients:**
   - Factorials are involved in binomial coefficients, which represent the coefficients in the expansion of binomial expressions. The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is equal to $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

3. **Probability and Statistics:**
   - Factorials are used in probability and statistics, especially in permutations and combinations, which are fundamental concepts in probability theory.

4. **Taylor Series:**
   - Factorials appear in the terms of the Taylor series expansion of certain functions, such as the exponential function and trigonometric functions.

5. **Recursive Algorithms:**
   - Factorials are used in recursive algorithms and programming, where they are calculated using recurrence relations. For example, the factorial of $n$ can be expressed as $n \times (n-1)!$.

6. **Analysis of Algorithms:**
   - Factorials are involved in the analysis of the time complexity of algorithms, particularly those with recursive structures that lead to factorial time complexity.

7. **Physics and Engineering:**
   - Factorials appear in mathematical expressions that model various physical phenomena and engineering problems, such as in the solutions to differential equations.

8. **Mathematical Induction:**
   - Factorials are often used in proofs by mathematical induction, where properties are established for a base case and then shown to hold for all subsequent cases.

The factorial function is a fundamental concept with broad applications in mathematics and related fields. Its properties and applications make it a crucial tool in various mathematical and computational contexts.
