**Course Description:** Examine ideas of quantity, variable, rate of change, and formula that are necessary for succeeding in and learning precalculus and calculus. Develop meaningful formulas and graphs to represent the patterns (linear, quadratic, exponential, trigonometric) of how two quantities change together, and develop and interpret function formulas and graphs to represent quantitative relationships in applied contexts.
