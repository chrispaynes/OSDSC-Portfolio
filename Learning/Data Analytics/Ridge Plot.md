A Ridge Plot, also known as a Joy Plot, is a data visualization technique used to display the distributions of multiple variables in a compact and visually appealing way. It is particularly useful when comparing the distributions of several groups or categories. The Ridge Plot combines elements of density plots or kernel density plots for each variable along with an overlaid "ridgeline" plot for better comparison.

Key features of Ridge Plots:

1. **Density Plots for Each Variable**: Each variable or category is represented by a density plot, typically using a smoothed kernel density estimation. These density plots provide information about the distribution of values for each variable.

2. **Overlapping and Stacking**: Ridge Plots stack the density plots vertically, allowing for easy visual comparison of multiple distributions. Overlapping areas indicate regions where the distributions of different variables coincide.

3. **Color Gradients**: The areas under the density curves are often filled with color gradients, making it easier to distinguish between different variables and understand the degree of overlap.

4. **Faceting**: Ridge Plots can be faceted or grouped by a categorical variable, enabling the comparison of distributions within different subgroups.

5. **Ridgeline Plot**: The overlaid ridgeline plot is formed by connecting the peaks of the density curves for each variable, creating a ridge-like appearance. This helps to emphasize the overall pattern and trend across variables.

Ridge Plots are particularly useful when dealing with a moderate number of distributions and aim to provide a compact visualization of their shapes and overlaps. They are commonly used in exploratory data analysis and data visualization tasks, especially in fields such as statistics, data science, and social sciences.

The term "Joy Plot" was coined by the authors of the "Joy Division" album cover, which served as inspiration for the visual style. The name "Ridge Plot" is often used interchangeably, especially when referring to the visualization technique in a broader context.
