Looker is a business intelligence and data exploration platform that enables organizations to analyze and visualize their data for informed decision-making. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data exploration, reporting, and dashboard creation, making it easier for users to access and derive insights from their data. Here's an overview of Looker's key features and capabilities:

1. **Data Exploration**:

6. **Scheduled Data Delivery**:
   - Looker allows users to schedule and automate the delivery of reports and dashboards to email, Slack, or other distribution channels. This feature ensures that relevant data reaches decision-makers on time.

7. **Data Exploration and Drill-Down**:
   - Users can explore data at various levels of detail. They can drill down into specific data points to investigate the underlying information.

8. **Data Security and Governance**:
   - Looker provides data access controls, authentication, and authorization features to ensure data security. Administrators can define who can access which data and reports.
