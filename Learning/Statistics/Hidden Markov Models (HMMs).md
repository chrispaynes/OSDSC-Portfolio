==Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models that are used to represent a system that evolves over time. They are particularly useful for modeling sequences of observations or events where the underlying system is not directly observable, but can be inferred based on the observed data.== HMMs belong to the broader class of probabilistic graphical models.

Here are the key components and concepts associated with Hidden Markov Models:

1. **States**: HMMs consist of a finite set of hidden states, each of which represents a particular situation or condition. The states are not directly observable.

2. **Observations**: At each time step, the system emits an observable symbol or observation based on the current hidden state. The set of possible observations is finite.

3. **Transition Probabilities**: There are probabilities associated with transitioning from one hidden state to another. These transition probabilities are represented by a transition matrix.

4. **Emission Probabilities**: For each hidden state, there is a probability distribution over possible observations. These emission probabilities are represented by an emission matrix.

5. **Initial State Probabilities**: The model also includes probabilities associated with the initial hidden state.

The dynamic nature of HMMs involves transitions between hidden states over time, with each transition associated with an emission of an observable symbol. The sequence of observable symbols is what is directly observed in the data.

Applications of Hidden Markov Models:

- **Speech Recognition**: Modeling phoneme sequences as hidden states with observable acoustic signals as emissions.
  
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical category (e.g., noun, verb) of each word in a sequence.

- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing biological sequences, such as DNA or protein sequences.

- **Finance**: Modeling financial time series data where underlying states represent different market conditions.

- **Natural Language Processing**: Named entity recognition, language modeling, and machine translation.

Inference in HMMs often involves problems like the Forward-Backward algorithm for computing the probability of an observation sequence, the Viterbi algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states given observations, and the Baum-Welch algorithm for training the model parameters based on observed data.

Hidden Markov Models are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dependencies in sequential data when the underlying system's state is not directly observable but can be inferred from observable outcomes.
