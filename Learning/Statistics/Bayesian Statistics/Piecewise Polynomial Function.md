A piecewise polynomial function is a mathematical function that is defined by different polynomial expressions on distinct intervals, or "pieces," of its domain. These polynomial pieces are connected at specific points, called knots, to ensure continuity of the function and, in some cases, its derivatives. The resulting function is a combination of polynomial segments that together form a continuous and often smooth curve.

A piecewise polynomial function of degree \(n\) consists of polynomial expressions of degree at most \(n\) on each interval. Common types of piecewise polynomial functions include linear splines, quadratic splines, cubic splines, and more, depending on the degree of the polynomial used on each interval.

Here are a few examples of piecewise polynomial functions:

1. **Linear Spline (Piecewise Linear Function):**
   - A linear spline is a piecewise linear function. On each interval between consecutive knots, the function is defined by a linear polynomial. If \(x_i\) and \(x_{i+1}\) are consecutive knots, the linear spline on the interval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\) is given by:
     \[f(x) = a_i(x - x_i) + b_i\]
   - The coefficients \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are determined to ensure continuity at the knots.

2. **Quadratic Spline (Piecewise Quadratic Function):**
   - A quadratic spline is a piecewise quadratic function. On each interval, the function is defined by a quadratic polynomial. If \(x_i\), \(x_{i+1}\), and \(x_{i+2}\) are consecutive knots, the quadratic spline on the interval \([x_i, x_{i+2}]\) is given by:
     \[f(x) = a_i(x - x_i)^2 + b_i(x - x_i) + c_i\]
   - The coefficients \(a_i\), \(b_i\), and \(c_i\) are determined to ensure continuity at the knots.

3. **Cubic Spline (Piecewise Cubic Function):**
   - A cubic spline is a piecewise cubic function. On each interval, the function is defined by a cubic polynomial. If \(x_i\), \(x_{i+1}\), \(x_{i+2}\), and \(x_{i+3}\) are consecutive knots, the cubic spline on the interval \([x_i, x_{i+3}]\) is given by:
     \[f(x) = a_i(x - x_i)^3 + b_i(x - x_i)^2 + c_i(x - x_i) + d_i\]
   - The coefficients \(a_i\), \(b_i\), \(c_i\), and \(d_i\) are determined to ensure continuity and smoothness at the knots.

Piecewise polynomial functions are widely used in various applications, including interpolation, curve fitting, and the construction of smooth curves that approximate complex data sets. The choice of the degree of the polynomial and the specific form of the piecewise polynomial function depends on the requirements of the problem at hand.
