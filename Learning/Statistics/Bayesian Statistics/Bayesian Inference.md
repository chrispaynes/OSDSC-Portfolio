Bayesian inference is a statistical approach that involves updating probability estimates for hypotheses or model parameters based on new evidence or observed data. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician, and is rooted in Bayesian probability theory.

The central idea of Bayesian inference is to use Bayes' theorem to revise beliefs about the probability of hypotheses or model parameters in light of new information. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(\text{Hypothesis} | \text{Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data} | \text{Hypothesis}) \cdot P(\text{Hypothesis})}{P(\text{Data})} \]

Here:
- \( P(\text{Hypothesis} | \text{Data}) \) is the posterior probability, representing the updated probability of a hypothesis given the observed data.
- \( P(\text{Data} | \text{Hypothesis}) \) is the likelihood, representing the probability of observing the data given the hypothesis.
- \( P(\text{Hypothesis}) \) is the prior probability, representing the initial belief or probability of the hypothesis before observing any data.
- \( P(\text{Data}) \) is the probability of the data, acting as a normalizing constant.

Key components of Bayesian inference:

1. **Prior Probability (Prior Beliefs)**: Bayesian inference starts with a prior probability distribution representing the initial beliefs about the likelihood of different hypotheses or values of model parameters. This can incorporate existing knowledge or subjective beliefs.

2. **Likelihood Function**: The likelihood function represents the probability of observing the given data under a specific hypothesis or set of parameters. It quantifies how well the data supports the hypothesis.

3. **Posterior Probability (Updated Beliefs)**: Using Bayes' theorem, the prior probability is updated with the observed data to obtain the posterior probability. The posterior represents the updated beliefs about the hypotheses or parameters given the observed data.

4. **Evidence or Marginal Likelihood**: The evidence or marginal likelihood, \( P(\text{Data}) \), is the probability of the observed data under all possible hypotheses. It serves as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum to 1.

Bayesian inference provides a coherent framework for incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs as new data becomes available. It is particularly useful in situations with limited data or when prior information is available. Bayesian methods are applied in various fields, including machine learning, biology, finance, and epidemiology, where uncertainty and the need for continuous updating of beliefs are common.
