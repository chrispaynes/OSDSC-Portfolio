In statistics, there are two primary ==types of errors that can occur when conducting hypothesis tests and making decisions based on data==: Type I errors and Type II errors. These errors are related to the correctness of decisions made during hypothesis testing.

1. **Type I Error (False Positive)**:
   - ==A Type I error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually true is incorrectly rejected.==
   - In other words, it is the error of concluding that there is a significant effect or difference when there is, in fact, no such effect or difference.
   - ==The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the significance level, typically represented by the symbol α (alpha). Commonly used significance levels include 0.05 and 0.01.==

   Example: Concluding that a new drug is effective in treating a disease when, in reality, it has no effect.

2. **Type II Error (False Negative)**:
   - ==A Type II error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually false is not rejected, or when a true effect or difference goes undetected.==
   - It is the error of failing to recognize a significant effect or difference when it does exist.
   - ==The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by the symbol β (beta).==

   Example: Failing to detect that a new drug is effective in treating a disease when it, in fact, has a positive effect.

==It's important to note that there is an inverse relationship between Type I and Type II errors. By lowering the significance level (α) to reduce the risk of Type I errors, you typically increase the risk of Type II errors. Conversely, by raising the significance level, you may decrease the risk of Type II errors but increase the risk of Type I errors.==

==To quantify the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, statistical power (1 - β) is often considered. Statistical power represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, and it is inversely related to the probability of a Type II error.==

==When designing hypothesis tests and experiments, researchers aim to strike a balance between these two types of errors based on the specific context and consequences of each type of error. This trade-off is important for making informed decisions and drawing valid conclusions from statistical analyses.==
