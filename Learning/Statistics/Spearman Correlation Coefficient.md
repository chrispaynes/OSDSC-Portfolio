The **Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ or Spearman’s rho)** is a **non-parametric** measure of statistical dependence between two variables. Unlike Pearson correlation, which measures **linear relationships**, Spearman correlation assesses **monotonic relationships**—meaning it captures relationships where as one variable increases, the other tends to increase or decrease, but not necessarily at a constant rate.

  

**How It Works:**

1. **Rank the Data:** Convert both variables into **ranked values** (i.e., replace each value with its position in the sorted list).

2. **Compute Differences (d) Between Ranks:** Find the difference between each pair of ranks.

3. **Apply the Formula:**

  
  

$\rho = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$
  

where:

• = difference between ranks of corresponding values

• = number of observations

  

**Key Properties:**

• **Ranges from -1 to 1:**

• $\rho = 1$  → Perfect positive correlation (higher X always means higher Y)

• $\rho = -1$ → Perfect negative correlation (higher X always means lower Y)

• $\rho = 0$ → No correlation

• **Captures Monotonicity:** Works even if the relationship is **nonlinear**, as long as it is consistently increasing or decreasing.

• **Robust to Outliers:** Less sensitive to extreme values than Pearson correlation.

**Practical Use Cases**

1. **Feature Selection in Machine Learning:** Identify relationships between variables when data is not normally distributed.

2. **Financial Markets:** Measure the rank correlation between stock prices and macroeconomic indicators.

3. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Understand monotonic relationships between user engagement and product features.

4. **Bioinformatics:** Analyze gene expression correlations when data distributions are skewed.

5. **Social Sciences & Psychology:** Assess the association between ordinal variables like survey responses.
