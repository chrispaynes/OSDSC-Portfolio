Statistical lift, often referred to as simply "lift," is a measure used in marketing, data mining, and predictive analytics to assess the effectiveness of a predictive model or a marketing campaign. It helps answer the question: "How much better is the model or campaign at identifying the target variable compared to random chance?"

Lift is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to prioritize certain outcomes or groups within a dataset, such as identifying potential customers who are more likely to respond to a marketing offer or detecting instances of fraud in a dataset.

Here's how lift is calculated and interpreted:

1. **Define a Baseline:** The first step in calculating lift is to establish a baseline. This baseline is typically the expected outcome if no model or campaign were used, and selections were made randomly. In marketing, this might be the response rate without any targeted marketing efforts.

2. **Calculate the Lift:** Lift is calculated as the ratio of the success rate with the model or campaign (e.g., the proportion of positive outcomes among those selected) to the success rate without the model or campaign (the baseline). The formula for calculating lift is as follows:

   Lift = (Response Rate with Model / Response Rate without Model)

   Alternatively, you can express it as a percentage by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100:

   Lift Percentage = ((Response Rate with Model / Response Rate without Model) - 1) * 100

3. **Interpretation:**
   - If the lift is greater than 1, it indicates that the model or campaign is performing better than random chance. The higher the lift, the more effective the model or campaign is at identifying the target variable.
   - If the lift is equal to 1, it means that the model or campaign is no better than random chance. In other words, it provides no advantage.
   - If the lift is less than 1, it suggests that the model or campaign is performing worse than random chance, and selections made by the model or campaign are less effective than random selection.

4. **Practical Use:** Lift helps organizations determine the effectiveness of their predictive models or marketing efforts. For example, if a marketing campaign has a lift of 2, it means that the campaign is twice as effective at identifying potential customers compared to random selection. This information can guide resource allocation and strategy adjustments.

In summary, statistical lift is a valuable metric for assessing the performance of predictive models and marketing campaigns, providing insights into how much better they are at identifying the desired outcomes compared to random chance. It helps organizations make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts and resources.
