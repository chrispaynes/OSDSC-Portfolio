==A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible outcomes of a random variable in a given experiment or scenario. It provides a way to quantify the uncertainty associated with different values of the random variable. In other words, a probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the various possible outcomes.==

There are two main types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous.
1. **Discrete Probability Distribution**:
   - **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: For discrete random variables, the probability distribution is described by a probability mass function (PMF). The PMF gives the probability of each possible outcome.
   - Example: The probability distribution of rolling a fair six-sided die can be described by a PMF.

2. **Continuous Probability Distribution**:
   - **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: For continuous random variables, the probability distribution is described by a probability density function (PDF). The PDF represents the density of probabilities rather than probabilities themselves. The probability of a continuous random variable falling within a specific interval is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.
   - Example: The normal distribution has a PDF that describes the probabilities of different values.

Some common probability distributions include:

- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**: Symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution frequently encountered in nature.

It's important to note that a probability distribution satisfies two key properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: Probabilities are non-negative (i.e., \(P(X) \geq 0\) for all values of \(X\)).

2. **Total Probability**: The sum (for discrete distributions) or integral (for continuous distributions) of all probabilities is equal to 1 (i.e., \(\sum P(X) = 1\) or \(\int P(X) \, dX = 1\)).

Probability distributions play a fundamental role in statistics and probability theory, providing a mathematical framework for describing and analyzing uncertainty in various contexts.
