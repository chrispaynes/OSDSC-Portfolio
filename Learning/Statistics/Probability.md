Yes, there is a distinction between likelihood and probability, and they are used in different contexts in statistics and probability theory.

1. **Probability**:

   - **Definition**: ==Probability measures the likelihood of a future event or the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment or process.==
   
   - **Interpretation**: ==It quantifies the chances of different outcomes and follows the rules of probability theory, such as being between 0 and 1 (inclusive), with 0 indicating impossibility and 1 indicating certainty.==
   
   - **Example**: If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a $3$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ because there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of six possible outcomes.

In summary, while both probability and likelihood involve the concept of "likelihood," they are used in different ways:

- **Probability** ==deals with future events and quantifies the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment.==

It's important to be mindful of this distinction to avoid confusion, especially in the context of statistical inference and hypothesis testing.
