Statistical covariation, often simply referred to as "covariation," is a term used in statistics to describe the tendency of two variables to change together. Specifically, it refers to the manner in which the values of one variable tend to vary in relation to the values of another variable. In essence, covariation quantifies the degree to which two variables move in conjunction with each other. 

Key points about statistical covariation:

1. **Relationship Between Variables**: Covariation occurs when there is a discernible pattern or trend in the data that shows how changes in one variable correspond to changes in another variable. For example, when one variable tends to increase as the other variable increases, there is a positive covariation.

2. **Types of Covariation**:
   - **Positive Covariation**: This occurs when an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in the other variable, and a decrease in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other.
   - **Negative Covariation**: This occurs when an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other variable, and vice versa.
   - **No Covariation (Zero Covariation)**: When there is no systematic relationship between two variables, and changes in one variable do not predict changes in the other, it is said that there is no covariation.

3. **Quantification**: While the term "covariation" describes the existence of a relationship between variables, quantifying the strength and direction of this relationship is typically done using statistical measures such as correlation coefficients, with the Pearson correlation coefficient being one of the most common.

4. **Interpretation**: Positive covariation can be interpreted as a positive association or a tendency for the variables to increase or decrease together. Negative covariation implies a negative association, meaning one variable tends to increase as the other decreases and vice versa.

5. **Limitations**: Covariation does not imply causation. While a strong covariation between two variables indicates a relationship, it does not establish that one variable causes changes in the other. Causation can only be determined through experimental design and causal analysis.

6. **Applications**: Covariation is a fundamental concept in various fields of statistics and is widely used in research, data analysis, and data exploration to understand how two or more variables are related.

In summary, statistical covariation describes the manner in which two variables change together. It is a crucial concept in statistical analysis and provides valuable insights into the relationships between variables, but it does not on its own establish a causal relationship.
