Deterministic and non-deterministic are terms used to describe systems or processes based on the predictability of their outcomes.

1. **Deterministic**:
   - **Definition**: A deterministic system is one in which the outcome or behavior is entirely predictable based on the initial conditions and the rules governing the system.
   - **Predictability**: In a deterministic system, if you know the initial state and the rules, you can accurately predict the future state of the system.
   - **Examples**:
     - Classical physics is often considered deterministic. If you know the initial positions and velocities of particles and the forces acting on them, you can predict their future positions.

2. **Non-Deterministic**:
   - **Definition**: A non-deterministic system is one in which the outcome is not entirely predictable, even if you know the initial conditions and the rules governing the system.
   - **Randomness or Uncertainty**: Non-deterministic systems involve elements of randomness, uncertainty, or inherent unpredictability.
   - **Examples**:
     - Quantum mechanics is often considered non-deterministic. The behavior of particles at the quantum level is probabilistic, and certain properties, like the exact position of a particle, cannot be precisely predicted.

In computing and algorithms:

- **Deterministic Algorithm**: ==An algorithm is deterministic if it produces the same output for a given set of inputs every time it is executed. The outcome is entirely determined by the inputs and the algorithm's logic.==
  
- **Non-Deterministic Algorithm**: ==An algorithm is non-deterministic if, even with the same inputs, it may produce different outputs in different runs. Non-deterministic algorithms often involve elements of randomness or uncertainty.==

In summary, the terms "deterministic" and "non-deterministic" are used to describe the predictability of outcomes in various systems, whether in physics, computing, or other fields. Deterministic systems have outcomes that can be precisely predicted, while non-deterministic systems involve some level of unpredictability or randomness.
