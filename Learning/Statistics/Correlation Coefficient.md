The correlation coefficient is a ==statistical measure that quantifies the degree of linear relationship between two variables.==

==It provides insights into how changes in one variable correspond to changes in another.== The correlation coefficient is denoted by the symbol $r$ and ranges from -1 to 1.

- $r = 1$ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship: as one variable increases, the other variable also increases proportionally.
- $r = -1$ indicates a perfect negative linear relationship: as one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally.
- $r = 0$ indicates no linear relationship between the variables.

The formula for the correlation coefficient $r$ between variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by:

$r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X) \cdot \text{Var}(Y)}}$

Here, $\text{Cov}(X, Y)$ represents the covariance between $X$ and $Y$, and $\text{Var}(X)$ and $\text{Var}(Y)$ represent the variances of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.

The correlation coefficient is a widely used measure in statistics, ==providing a standardized way to describe the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.== It is essential in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and social sciences.
