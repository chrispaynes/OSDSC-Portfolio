In algebra, a rational function is ==a function that can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials, where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials.== The general form of a rational function is:

$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$

Here:
- $f(x)$ is the rational function.
- $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$.
- $Q(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.

==The domain of a rational function is the set of all real numbers $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is not equal to zero, as division by zero is undefined.==

Rational functions can exhibit various behaviors based on the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials. Here are some key points:

1. ==**Vertical Asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is equal to zero and the numerator is not. The function approaches infinity or negative infinity as it gets close to a vertical asymptote.==

2. ==**Horizontal Asymptotes:** Horizontal asymptotes describe the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity. The degree of the numerator and denominator determines the presence and location of horizontal asymptotes.==

3. **Holes:** Rational functions may have removable discontinuities called holes. These occur when a factor in the numerator and the same factor in the denominator cancel each other out.

4. **Slant Asymptotes (Oblique Asymptotes):** In some cases, when the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, there may be a slant asymptote.

Examples of rational functions include:

- $f(x) = \frac{2x^2 - 3x + 1}{x - 2}$
- $g(x) = \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 6}{x^2 - 4}$
- $h(x) = \frac{5}{x + 1}$

Rational functions are important in algebra and calculus, and they are often used to model various real-world phenomena. They appear in the study of limits, derivatives, and integrals.
