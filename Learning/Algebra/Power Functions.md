In algebra, a power function is a ==mathematical function of the form $f(x) = ax^n$, where $a$ and $n$ are constants, and $x$ is the variable. The exponent $n$ can be any real number, positive or negative, and it determines the degree or power of the function.==

The general form of a power function is:

$f(x) = ax^n$

Here:
- ==$x$ is the variable==.
- ==$a$ is the coefficient or constant factor.==
- ==$n$ is the exponent, which determines the degree of the function.==

Power functions can take various forms based on the value of $n$, leading to different types of functions. Here are a few examples:

1. **Linear Function ($n = 1$):**
   $f(x) = ax$
   Example: $f(x) = 2x + 3$

2. **Quadratic Function ($n = 2$):**
   $f(x) = ax^2$
   Example: $f(x) = 4x^2 - 5x + 2$

3. **Cubic Function ($n = 3$):**
   $f(x) = ax^3$
   Example: $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 1$

4. **Square Root Function ($n = 0.5$):**
   $f(x) = a\sqrt{x}$
   Example: $f(x) = 3\sqrt{x}$

5. **Inverse Square Function ($n = -2$):**
   $f(x) = \frac{a}{x^2}$
   Example: $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$

==Power functions are a fundamental class of functions in algebra, and they exhibit different behaviors based on the value of the exponent $n$.== 

==The degree of the function is determined by the highest power of $x$ in the expression. Linear, quadratic, and cubic functions are specific cases of power functions with $n = 1, 2,$ and $3$, respectively.==
