`-/-` -> positive value
`+/-` -> negative value
`±` indicates a choice of exactly two possible values, one of which is obtained through addition and the other through subtraction.
	- when simplifying an equation and you need to square both sides to simplify the equation (eg: remove power of y), you need use `±` on the side that still uses the square root. this is needed for y values raised to an even value. Not for odd powers such as cube root resulting from simplifying y^3
	- 
`√` cancels out a power of 2 since they are inverse functions `√x**2` = `x`
- you need a common denominator to add fractions
- fraction multiplied by a fraction
- fraction divided by a fraction you can reciprocate and multiply
	- multiply be the reciprocal of the second fraction
- multiplication and addition is commutive - order of operands doesn't matter
	- substraction and division is not
Tips for Factoring Equations
	- put your polynomials in descending order. Exponents with largest values value on the left, then next largest, then next, ...
	- find the Great Common Factor for all values
	- you can factor values that are not a perfect square

	- when simplifying and you divide by a number, you're trying to get positive 1 as a coefficient in front of y
	- when you have `y` on multiple terms, get all terms with `y` on one side of `=` and get all other terms on the other side
		- this allows for factoring (Finding what to multiply together to get an expression) the numbers

## Algebraic Properties
![[Pasted image 20230807205620.png]]
	exponents distribute across multiplication and division, but not addition or subtraction

	- think of the numerator as "number of slices you'll take out of a whole pizza"
	- think of the denominator as "total number of slices in a whole pizza"
