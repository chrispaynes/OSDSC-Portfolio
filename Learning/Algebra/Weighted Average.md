A weighted average is a type of average where different values are given different weights based on their significance or importance. It is calculated by multiplying each value by its respective weight, summing up these products, and then dividing the total by the sum of the weights. The purpose of using weights is to reflect the influence or contribution of each value in the overall average.

The formula for calculating a weighted average is:

$$ \text{Weighted Average} = \frac{w_1 \cdot x_1 + w_2 \cdot x_2 + \ldots + w_n \cdot x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \ldots + w_n} $$

Where:
- $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are the weights assigned to each value \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\).
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the values being averaged.

For example, in financial contexts, a weighted average might be used to calculate the average interest rate on a portfolio of loans, where each loan amount serves as its weight. Similarly, in academic grading, a weighted average can be employed to calculate the overall grade by assigning different weights to individual course grades based on credit hours. The weighted average provides a more accurate representation of the central tendency when certain values have more influence on the overall result.
