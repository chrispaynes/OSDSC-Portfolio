- it can be difficult to measure how data contributes to organizational success. These differences also raise other issues that affect data management, such as:
	- Inventorying how much data an organization has
	- Defining data ownership and accountability
	- Protecting against the misuse of data
	- Managing risks associated with data
## Data represents risk
- **Misuse:** If data consumers do not have sufficient and correct information (Metadata) about the data they use, then there is a risk of data being misused or misunderstood.
- **Unreliability:** If data quality and reliability have not been established through standards and measurements, then there is a risk that unreliable data will be used to make decisions.
- **Inappropriate use**: If data is not protected and secured, then there is a risk that data will be used by unauthorized people for unauthorized purposes.

- Moreover, because data represents people, products, and money, legislators and regulators have recognized the potential uses and abuses of information and have put in place laws intended to mitigate obvious risks.
	- Sarbanes-Oxley in the US focuses on controls over accuracy and validity of financial transaction data from transaction to balance sheet
	- Solvency II in the EU focuses on data lineage and the quality of data underpinning risk models and capital adequacy in the insurance sector

## Poor quality data costs money
- To ensure data meets business needs, data management teams must work with data consumers to define the characteristics that make data of high quality.
- Many of the costs of poor quality data are hidden and indirect and therefore hard to measure.
### The corresponding benefits of high quality data include:
- Improved customer experience
- Higher productivity
- Reduced risk 
- Ability to act on opportunities
- Increased revenue
- Competitive advantage gained from insights on customers, products, processes, and opportunities
- Competitive advantage gained from demonstrable data security and data quality

As these costs and benefits imply, managing data quality is not a one-time thing. Producing high-quality data requires planning, commitment, and a mindset that builds quality into processes and systems.

### Data valuation is not standardized
One approach to data valuation is to define general cost and benefit categories that can be applied consistently within an organization. Sample categories include:
- Cost of obtaining and storing data
- Cost of replacing data if it were lost
- Impact to the organization if data were missing
- Potential costs of risks associated with data
- Cost of risk mitigation  
- Cost of improving data 
- Benefits of higher quality data 
- What competitors would pay for data 
- What the data could be sold for 
- Expected revenue from innovative uses of data
- often temporal (i.e., what was valuable yesterday may not be valuable today).

## Data management means managing data’s lifecycle
- **Creation and usage are the most critical points in the data lifecycle:**
	- Data management must be executed with an understanding of how data is produced, or obtained, as well as how data is used. It costs money to produce data. Data is valuable only when it is consumed or applied.
- **Data quality must be managed throughout the data lifecycle:**
	- Because the quality of data can be impacted by a range of lifecycle events, quality must be planned for as part of the data lifecycle. It is not an add-on, or something to be ‘done later.’
- **Metadata quality must be managed through the data lifecycle:**
	- Metadata is a type of data that is used to describe other data. As such, it is critical to all data management functions. Metadata is often created as part of the lifecycle of other data and should be seen as a product (rather than a by-product) of that lifecycle. Metadata quality must be managed in the same way as the quality of other data.
- **Data Security must be managed throughout the data lifecycle:**
	- Data management includes ensuring that data is secure and that risks associated with data are mitigated. Data that requires protection must be protected throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.
- **Data management efforts should focus on the most critical data:**
	- Organizations produce a lot of data, much of which is never actually used.[8] Trying to manage every piece of data is neither possible nor desirable. Lifecycle management requires focusing on an organization’s most critical data and minimizing data ROT (i.e., data that is redundant, obsolete, or trivial).[

## Different kinds of data have different lifecycle requirements
- Data can be classified by the function it serves (e.g., transactional data, Reference Data, Master Data, Metadata; alternatively, category data, resource data, event data, detailed transaction data) or by content (e.g., data domains, subject areas) or by format or by the level of protection the data requires. Data can also be classified by how and where it is stored or accessed.

## Metadata must be managed as part of the data lifecycle
- You cannot manage data without Metadata. Metadata includes a range of information that allows people to understand data and the systems that contain data.
- Metadata describes what data an organization has, what it represents, how it is classified, where it came from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves through use, who can and cannot use it, and whether it is of high quality.

## Data management is often confused with information technology management
Successful data management requires sound decisions about technology, but managing technology is not the same as managing data. Organizations need to understand the impact of technology on data, in order to prevent technological temptation from driving their decisions about data. Instead, data requirements aligned with business strategy should drive decisions about technology.

## Data management requires a range of skills
- Business process skills to understand and plan for the creation of reliable data
- Design skills to plan for systems where data will be stored or used
- Highly technical skills to administer hardware and build software where data is maintained
- Data analysis skills to understand issues and problems discovered in data
- Analytic skills to interpret data and apply it to new problems
- Language skills to bring consensus to definitions and models so that people can understand data
- Strategic thinking to see opportunities to use data to serve customers and meet goals

## Data management requires an enterprise perspective
- Data is one of the ‘horizontals’ of an organization. It moves across verticals, such as sales, marketing, and operations.
- Because data is often viewed simply as a by-product of operational processes (for example, sales transaction records are the by-product of the selling process, not an end in themselves), it is not always planned for beyond the immediate need. It may not even be recognized as something that other people and processes use.
- Formatting differences, differences in the granularity of data, and differences about which attributes are mandatory to capture – all of these differences present obstacles to integrating data from diverse applications.
- Organizations that view data as a product that they create or purchase will make better decisions about how to manage it throughout its lifecycle. These decisions require recognizing:
	- The ways data connects business processes that might otherwise be seen as separate
	- The relationship between business processes and the technology that supports them
	- The design and architecture of systems and the data they produce and store
	- The ways data might be used to advance organizational strategy

# Chapter 3 - DAMA’s Data Management Principles
- data management still shares characteristics with other forms of management. It involves knowing what data an organization has and what might be accomplished with it, then determining how best to use data assets to reach organizational goals. Like other management processes, it must balance strategic and operational needs. It must also account for the unique properties of data
