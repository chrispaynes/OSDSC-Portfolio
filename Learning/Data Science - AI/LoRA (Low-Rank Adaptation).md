LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs). Instead of updating all model weights, LoRA injects small, trainable low-rank matrices into transformer layers while keeping the pre-trained model frozen. This drastically reduces computational costs and memory usage while maintaining high performance.

  

**Key Benefits:**

• **Efficiency:** Requires fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning.

• **Memory Savings:** Reduces VRAM requirements, enabling fine-tuning on consumer GPUs.

• **Modularity:** Allows multiple task-specific adapters without modifying the original model.

  

**Practical Use Cases for LoRA**

1. **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Adapting LLMs to legal, medical, or financial domains without full retraining.

2. **Multilingual Adaptation:** Enhancing a model’s performance in underrepresented languages.

3. **Task-Specific Customization:** Improving chatbots for customer service, healthcare, or code generation.

4. **Personalized AI Assistants:** Training lightweight adapters for individual user preferences.

5. **Edge AI & On-Device Models:** Deploying efficient fine-tuned models on mobile and embedded systems.
