A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is a type of tree structure where each node in the tree can have zero, one, or two children. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

Key characteristics of a Binary Tree:

1. **Root:** The topmost node in the tree is called the root. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.

2. **Nodes:** Each node in a binary tree contains a data element (or key) and has references (or pointers) to its left and right children.

3. **Edges:** The edges represent the links between nodes. A node with no parent is the root, and nodes with no children are leaves.

4. **Left and Right Children:** Each node can have at most two children â€“ a left child and a right child. These children are ordered, meaning that there is a distinction between the left and right child.

Binary trees can be categorized further based on the order in which nodes are arranged:

- **Full Binary Tree:** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
  
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels of the tree are completely filled, except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

- **Perfect Binary Tree:** A binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

- **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree is balanced if the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most one.

Binary trees are used in a variety of applications and algorithms, including binary search trees (BST), expression trees, and heap data structures. They are fundamental to understanding more advanced tree structures and algorithms in computer science.
