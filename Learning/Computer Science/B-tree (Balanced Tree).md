A B-tree (Balanced Tree) is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is designed to keep the tree height balanced, ensuring that all leaf nodes are at the same level. This balance helps maintain optimal performance for search and modification operations.

Key characteristics of B-trees include:

1. **Balanced Structure:** The tree is kept balanced by redistributing keys among nodes during insertion and deletion, preventing it from becoming skewed.

2. **Node Structure:** Each node in a B-tree contains a certain number of keys and corresponding child pointers. The number of keys is within a specified range for each node, determined by a parameter called the "order" of the tree.

3. **Sorted Keys:** The keys in each node are sorted in ascending order, making it efficient for search operations using binary search.

4. **Efficient for Disk-Based Storage:** B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems where data is stored on disk. Their balanced structure minimizes the number of I/O operations required to access or modify data.

5. **Support for Range Queries:** B-trees provide efficient support for range queries, as the keys are sorted, and the structure allows for easy traversal of ranges.

Common variations of B-trees include B+ trees and B* trees. In a B+ tree, only the leaf nodes contain key values, and they are linked together to facilitate range queries. B* trees are a variation designed for better balance during insertions and deletions.

B-trees are widely used in database management systems, file systems, and other applications where efficient and balanced access to large amounts of data is essential.
