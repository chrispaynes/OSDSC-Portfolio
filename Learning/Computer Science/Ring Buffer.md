A Ring Buffer, also known as a Circular Buffer or Circular Queue, is a data structure that uses a fixed-size, pre-allocated buffer to store elements. The key feature of a Ring Buffer is its ability to wrap around, creating a circular or ring-like structure, which makes it particularly useful for scenarios where a continuous flow of data is required.

Key characteristics of a Ring Buffer:

1. **Fixed Size:** A Ring Buffer has a fixed size or capacity, determined when it is created. Once the buffer is full, adding new elements will overwrite existing elements in a circular manner.

2. **Head and Tail Pointers:** The Ring Buffer maintains two pointers, usually referred to as the "head" and "tail." The head points to the next available location for writing, and the tail points to the next element to be read.

3. **Circular Structure:** When the head or tail reaches the end of the buffer, it wraps around to the beginning. This creates a circular structure, allowing continuous storage and retrieval of elements.

4. **FIFO Behavior:** The Ring Buffer follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. The element that has been in the buffer the longest is the first to be read.

Ring Buffers are commonly used in scenarios where a continuous stream of data needs to be processed or stored. Some common applications include:

- **Audio Processing:** Ring Buffers are often used in audio processing to continuously stream and process audio samples.

- **Communication Buffers:** They are used in networking and communication systems to manage incoming and outgoing data streams.

- **Producer-Consumer Scenarios:** Ring Buffers can be employed as a communication mechanism between producers and consumers in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment.

- **Data Streaming:** In scenarios where data is continuously generated or consumed, a Ring Buffer can efficiently manage the flow of data.

The circular nature of Ring Buffers allows for efficient memory usage and avoids the need for expensive reallocation when dealing with continuous streams of data.
