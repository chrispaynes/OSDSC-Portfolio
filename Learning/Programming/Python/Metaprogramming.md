Decorators and metaprogramming are advanced features in Python that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of functions and classes dynamically. 

### Metaprogramming:

**1. What is Metaprogramming?**
   - Metaprogramming refers to writing code that manipulates or generates other code during runtime.
   - It involves creating or modifying classes, functions, or even modules dynamically.

**2. Metaclasses:**
   - In Python, classes are objects, and metaclasses define the rules for creating classes.
   - You can create custom metaclasses to control class creation and behavior.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class MyMeta(type):
         def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
             # Custom class creation logic
             return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

     class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
         # Class code
     ```

**3. `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`:**
   - These are special methods used for attribute access in classes.
   - They allow you to intercept attribute access and modify behavior dynamically.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class DynamicAttributes:
         def __getattr__(self, name):
             print(f"Attribute {name} not found.")
             return None

         def __setattr__(self, name, value):
             print(f"Setting attribute {name} to {value}")
             super().__setattr__(name, value)
     ```

**4. Code Generation:**
   - Dynamically generating code strings and executing them using `exec()` or `eval()` functions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     code_string = "print('Hello, World!')"
     exec(code_string)
     ```

**5. Decorators as Metaprogramming:**
   - Decorators themselves can be considered a form of metaprogramming, as they modify the behavior of functions dynamically.
   - Metaprogramming allows you to create decorators that generate or modify code based on certain conditions.

**6. Dynamic Class Creation:**
   - Creating classes dynamically at runtime based on certain conditions or configurations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def create_class(class_name, attributes):
         return type(class_name, (object,), attributes)

     MyClass = create_class('MyClass', {'attribute1': 42, 'attribute2': 'hello'})
     ```

Decorators and metaprogramming provide powerful tools for extending and customizing Python code dynamically. While decorators are widely used for enhancing functions, metaprogramming allows for more advanced code generation and manipulation.
