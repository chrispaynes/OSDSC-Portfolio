Certainly! Here is a list of some of the different operators and symbols used in the Python programming language, including those related to matrices:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - `+` Addition
   - `-` Subtraction
   - `*` Multiplication
   - `/` Division
   - `%` Modulus
   - `**` Exponentiation
   - `//` Floor Division

2. Comparison Operators:
   - `==` Equal to
   - `!=` Not equal to
   - `<` Less than
   - `>` Greater than
   - `<=` Less than or equal to
   - `>=` Greater than or equal to

3. Assignment Operators:
   - `=` Assignment
   - `+=` Add and assign
   - `-=` Subtract and assign
   - `*=` Multiply and assign
   - `/=` Divide and assign
   - `%=` Modulus and assign
   - `**=` Exponentiate and assign
   - `//=` Floor divide and assign

4. Logical Operators:
   - `and` Logical AND
   - `or` Logical OR
   - `not` Logical NOT

5. Bitwise Operators:
   - `&` Bitwise AND
   - `|` Bitwise OR
   - `^` Bitwise XOR
   - `~` Bitwise NOT
   - `<<` Left shift
   - `>>` Right shift

6. Membership Operators:
   - `in` Membership test
   - `not in` Negated membership test

7. Identity Operators:
   - `is` Object identity test
   - `is not` Negated object identity test

8. Matrix Operators (NumPy):
   - `@` Matrix multiplication (in Python 3.5 and later)

These operators are fundamental to performing various operations in Python, and understanding them is crucial for writing effective and concise code.
