In Python, a closure is a function object that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. This allows the function to "close over" the values of those variables, creating a closure. Closures are a result of the lexical scoping behavior in Python.

Here's a simple example to illustrate closures:

```python
def outer_function(x):
    # Inner function 'inner' is a closure because it references the 'x' from the outer scope.
    def inner(y):
        return x + y
    return inner

# Create closures 'closure1' and 'closure2' with different values for 'x'.
closure1 = outer_function(10)
closure2 = outer_function(20)

# Use the closures to perform calculations.
result1 = closure1(5)  # Result: 10 + 5 = 15
result2 = closure2(5)  # Result: 20 + 5 = 25

print(result1, result2)
```

In this example, `outer_function` takes a parameter `x` and defines an inner function `inner` that references `x`. When `outer_function` is called with different values for `x`, it returns closures (`closure1` and `closure2`) that "remember" the values of `x`. When these closures are later invoked with arguments (`5` in this case), they use the remembered values of `x` to perform calculations.

Closures are powerful because they allow functions to retain and manipulate the environment in which they were created. They are often used for creating function factories or for implementing data encapsulation.

It's important to note that closures are a natural consequence of Python's support for lexical scoping, which means that functions remember the scope in which they were defined.
