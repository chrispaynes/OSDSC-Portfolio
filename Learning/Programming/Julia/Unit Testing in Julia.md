In Julia, you can perform unit testing using the built-in `Test` module. Here's a basic guide on how to write and run unit tests in Julia:

1. **Writing Unit Tests:**
   Create a Julia script or module containing your functions and corresponding test functions. Test functions should use the `@test` macro from the `Test` module to assert conditions that should hold true.

   Example:
   ```julia
   module MyModule

   export add_numbers

   function add_numbers(x, y)
       return x + y
   end

   end  # module MyModule

   using Test
   using .MyModule  # Assuming the module is in the same file or included in the project

   # Test function for add_numbers
   @testset "add_numbers function tests" begin
       @test add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
       @test add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0
       @test_throws ArgumentError add_numbers("a", 3)
   end
   ```

2. **Running Tests:**
   Save your test script or module, and then run the tests. You can do this from the Julia REPL or by executing the script using the `include` function.

   Example (from REPL):
   ```julia
   using Test
   include("your_test_script.jl")  # Replace with the actual file path
   ```

3. **Test Results:**
   After running the tests, Julia will display the results. If all tests pass, you should see a message indicating that the tests were successful. If any test fails, Julia will provide information about which test failed and what the expected and actual results were.

   Example (successful run):
   ```
   Test Summary: | Pass  Total
   add_numbers function tests |    3      3
   ```

   Example (failed run):
   ```
   Test Summary: | Error  Total
   add_numbers function tests |     1      3
   ```

   The error message will indicate which test failed and why.

4. **Test Organization:**
   You can organize tests into test sets using the `@testset` macro. This helps group related tests together.

   Example:
   ```julia
   @testset "MyModule tests" begin
       # ... individual test expressions ...
   end
   ```

   You can also use the `@testset` macro to organize multiple test sets into a hierarchy.

   Example:
   ```julia
   @testset "MyModule" begin
       @testset "add_numbers function tests" begin
           # ... individual test expressions ...
       end

       @testset "another_function tests" begin
           # ... individual test expressions ...
       end
   end
   ```

This basic structure should help you get started with unit testing in Julia. For more advanced testing features, you may want to explore Julia's documentation on the `Test` module and related testing tools.
