Julia is a compiled language. Julia's design aims to provide both high-level abstractions for ease of use and performance close to low-level languages like C and Fortran. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to translate high-level Julia code into machine code for efficient execution.

When you run a Julia script or interact with the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), the Julia compiler analyzes and translates the code into machine code on-the-fly. This compilation process is why Julia can achieve performance comparable to statically-typed compiled languages while still offering the expressiveness of a dynamic, high-level language.

Julia's ability to dynamically compile code allows for optimizations based on the specific types used in the code, resulting in efficient execution. This is particularly beneficial for numerical and scientific computing tasks, where performance is crucial.
