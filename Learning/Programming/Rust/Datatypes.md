Rust has several built-in primitive data types that represent the basic building blocks of the language. Here are some of the main data types in Rust:

1. **Integers:**
   - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`: Signed integers with various bit sizes.
   - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`: Unsigned integers with various bit sizes.
   - `isize`, `usize`: Signed and unsigned integers that depend on the architecture (size of a pointer).

2. **Floating-Point Numbers:**
   - `f32`: 32-bit floating-point number.
   - `f64`: 64-bit floating-point number.

3. **Boolean:**
   - `bool`: Represents a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

4. **Characters:**
   - `char`: Represents a single Unicode character.

5. **Strings:**
   - `&str`: A string slice, which is an immutable reference to a string.
   - `String`: A heap-allocated, growable string.

6. **Tuples:**
   - A fixed-size ordered list of elements with different data types. For example, `(1, "hello", 3.14)`.

7. **Arrays:**
   - `[T; N]`: A fixed-size array of elements of type `T` with length `N`.

8. **Slices:**
   - `[T]`: A dynamically sized view into a contiguous sequence of elements of type `T`.

9. **Option and Result Enums:**
   - `Option<T>`: Represents an optional value, either `Some(T)` or `None`.
   - `Result<T, E>`: Represents the result of an operation, either `Ok(T)` or `Err(E)`.

10. **References and Pointers:**
    - `&T`: Immutable reference to a value of type `T`.
    - `&mut T`: Mutable reference to a value of type `T`.
    - `*const T` and `*mut T`: Raw pointers to a value of type `T`.

These are the fundamental data types in Rust, and the language is designed to be expressive and flexible while promoting memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. Additionally, Rust allows users to define their own custom data types through structs, enums, and other constructs.
