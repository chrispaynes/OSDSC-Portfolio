Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that supports various data types for storing and processing data. These data types are similar to those found in traditional relational databases but may have some specific variations. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, here are some of the common data types supported by Snowflake:

1. **Numeric Data Types**:
   - `NUMBER`: Used for numeric data with precision and scale.
   - `FLOAT`: Used for floating-point numbers.
   - `INTEGER`: Used for whole numbers.
   - `DECIMAL`: Used for fixed-point numeric values with precision and scale.

2. **Text Data Types**:
   - `STRING`: Used for character strings of variable length.
   - `CHAR`: Used for fixed-length character strings.
   - `VARCHAR`: Used for variable-length character strings.

3. **Binary Data Types**:
   - `BINARY`: Used for binary data, such as images or files.
   - `VARBINARY`: Used for variable-length binary data.

4. **Date and Time Data Types**:
   - `DATE`: Used for date values.
   - `TIME`: Used for time values.
   - `TIMESTAMP`: Used for date and time values.
   - `TIMEZONE`: Used for storing time zone information.
   - `INTERVAL`: Used for time intervals.

5. **Boolean Data Type**:
   - `BOOLEAN`: Used for boolean (true/false) values.

6. **Structured Data Types**:
   - `ARRAY`: Used for arrays or lists of values of the same data type.
   - `OBJECT`: Used for semi-structured data as JSON objects.
   - `VARIANT`: A flexible data type that can store various types of data, including structured and semi-structured data.

7. **Geospatial Data Types**:
   - `GEOMETRY`: Used for storing geometrical data, such as points, lines, and polygons, for geospatial analysis.

8. **UUID Data Type**:
   - `UUID`: Used for universally unique identifiers.

9. **Other Specialized Data Types**:
   - `SIGNED`: Used for signed integers.
   - `UNSIGNED`: Used for unsigned integers.
   - `ENUM`: Used for enumerations of predefined values.
   - `CURRENCY`: Used for currency values.

10. **Semistructured Data Types**:
    - Snowflake also supports handling semistructured data like JSON, Avro, and Parquet through VARIANT and OBJECT data types.

Keep in mind that Snowflake's data types and capabilities may evolve over time, and new data types may be introduced in future releases. It's essential to refer to the official Snowflake documentation or consult the latest documentation provided by Snowflake to ensure accuracy and completeness regarding data types and their usage in your specific version of Snowflake.
