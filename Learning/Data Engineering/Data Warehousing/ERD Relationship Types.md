In an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), relationships define the connections and associations between entities (tables) in a database. There are several types of relationships that can exist between entities. The common types of ERD relationship notation include:

1. **One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:**
    
    - A single instance in one entity is related to only one instance in another entity, and vice versa.
    - For example, each employee has only one social security number, and each social security number is assigned to only one employee.
2. **One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:**
    
    - A single instance in one entity is related to multiple instances in another entity.
    - For example, one department can have multiple employees, but each employee belongs to only one department.
3. **Many-to-One (M:1) Relationship:**
    
    - Multiple instances in one entity are related to a single instance in another entity.
    - It's essentially the inverse of a One-to-Many relationship.
    - For example, multiple customers can be associated with one sales representative.
4. **Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship:**
    
    - Multiple instances in one entity are related to multiple instances in another entity.
    - This type of relationship requires a junction or associative table to resolve the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships.
    - For example, students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

These relationships are represented in an ERD using various symbols and notations to visually depict how entities relate to each other within a database schema. The cardinality (the number of instances) and the participation constraints (whether a relationship is mandatory or optional) between entities are indicated by these relationship types.

A lot of ORM sites and SQL tutorials mention these relationships as if they are obvious or to be taken for granted, but I don't fully understand why the distinctions need to be made.
Consider two tables A and B, both with id fields, and linkage(s) between these two tables.

My understanding is that:
1. One-to-one relationship: If you have a row in A, you have at most one corresponding row in B, and vice-versa. I think in this sort of scenario you could probably just combine the tables, possibly, but that's beyond the scope.
2. One-to-many relationship: If you have a row in A, you can have any number of corresponding rows in B. But if you have a row in B, there is at most only one corresponding row in A.
3. Many-to-one relationship: Already described in 2.
4. Many-to-many relationship: If you have a row in A, there can be any number of corresponding rows in B. If you have a row in B, there can be any number of corresponding rows in A.
