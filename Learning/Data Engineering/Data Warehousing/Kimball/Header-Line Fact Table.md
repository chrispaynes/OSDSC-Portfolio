==A header/line fact table is a specific type of fact table structure used in data warehousing to manage complex transactional data that involves multiple related entities or components. It helps organize and store data about transactions with a hierarchical or multi-level structure.==

In a header/line fact table:

1. ==**Header Level:** The "header" represents the main transaction or event, containing high-level information that applies to the entire transaction. This level contains attributes that are common to the entire transaction, such as transaction ID, date, customer ID, or order ID.==

2. ==**Line Level:** The "line" represents the individual components or line items associated with the main transaction. Each line corresponds to a specific detail or item within the transaction. For example, in a sales order scenario, each line might represent a product sold, quantity, price, and related details.==

3. ==**Hierarchical Structure:** There is a hierarchical relationship between the header and line levels. The header serves as the parent entity, and the lines are the child entities associated with the parent transaction==.

4. ==**Attributes:** The header level contains attributes applicable to the entire transaction, while the line level contains detailed attributes specific to each individual line item.==

5. ==**Multiple Granularities:** Header/line fact tables allow for capturing data at multiple granularities. The header captures aggregate information about the entire transaction, while the line level provides detailed, item-level information.==

6. ==**Usage Scenarios:** This structure is commonly used in scenarios such as order management, invoices, purchase orders, or any transactional system where a single transaction involves multiple line items or components.==

For example, in a sales scenario:
- ==The header level might contain information about the sales order (order ID, customer ID, order date).==
- ==The line level would contain details about each product sold within that order (product ID, quantity, price).==

==This structure helps maintain a clear relationship between high-level transactional data and the detailed components associated with that transaction. It allows for efficient querying and analysis of both aggregated and detailed information within a single fact table.==
