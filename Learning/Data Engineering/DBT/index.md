DBT, which stands for "Data Build Tool," is an open-source command-line tool and modeling layer for data transformation in modern data warehouses. It is designed to help data analysts and data engineers transform data in a structured and version-controlled manner. DBT focuses on transforming raw data into analytics-ready data, often referred to as the process of data transformation or data modeling.

Here are some key features and aspects of DBT:

1. ==**SQL-Driven**: DBT primarily uses SQL queries to define and execute data transformations. You define SQL queries that describe how to transform raw data into the desired output, and DBT takes care of executing those queries.==

2. ==**Modular and Reusable**: DBT promotes the creation of modular and reusable transformations. You can define macros, models, and packages to encapsulate and reuse common transformation logic.==

3. **Version Control**: DBT projects can be version-controlled using Git, allowing you to track changes to your data transformation code over time and collaborate with team members.

4. ==**Dependency Management**: DBT manages dependencies between models, ensuring that transformations are executed in the correct order. It tracks which models depend on others and automatically determines the execution order.==

5. ==**Data Testing**: DBT allows you to define data tests to ensure the quality and correctness of transformed data. You can check for issues like missing values, duplicates, or unexpected changes.==

6. ==**Documentation**: DBT encourages the documentation of data transformations. You can provide descriptions, explanations, and annotations for your models to make them more understandable for others.==

7. **Cloud Data Warehouses**: DBT is commonly used with cloud-based data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift, although it can also be used with on-premises databases.

8. **Community and Plugins**: DBT has a vibrant community and supports a wide range of plugins and integrations that extend its functionality.

DBT has gained popularity in the data engineering and analytics community because it provides a structured and organized way to manage data transformations, which can be a critical part of building data pipelines and enabling data-driven decision-making in organizations. It helps transform raw data into a clean, structured, and well-documented format that is ready for analysis and reporting.

## Project Structure
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, DBT (Data Build Tool) did not have a standard "analyses" directory as part of its core project structure. However, the DBT project structure primarily consisted of the following directories:

1. ==**models**: This directory typically contains your DBT models, which are SQL files defining the logic for transforming, cleaning, and organizing your data.==

2. ==**data**: You can use this directory to store source data or other data files that your DBT project may need. It's not a required directory, and its use depends on your project's specific needs.==

3. ==**macros**: This directory holds custom SQL macros that you can define and use in your DBT models to reuse common SQL patterns or calculations.==

4. ==**analysis**: While not a standard directory in DBT, some users may create an "analysis" directory to store SQL queries or analysis scripts that are separate from the core DBT models. These queries may be ad-hoc analyses, exploration scripts, or reports that are not part of the core data transformation logic.==

It's important to note that the structure of a DBT project can be customized to fit your team's workflow and preferences. If you have a directory named "analyses" in your DBT project, it is likely a custom directory you or your team created to organize analysis-related SQL scripts separately from the core DBT models.

DBT's primary focus is on data modeling and transformation, but it can also be used to execute SQL queries and scripts for data analysis and reporting purposes. If you have specific questions or requirements related to the "analyses" directory in your DBT project, I recommend checking your project's documentation or consulting with your team to understand its purpose and usage within your specific context.

## Analyses Overview

dbt's notion of `models` makes it easy for data teams to version control and collaborate on data transformations. Sometimes though, a certain sql statement doesn't quite fit into the mold of a dbt model. ==These more "analytical" sql files can be versioned inside of your dbt project using the `analysis` functionality of dbt.==

==Any `.sql` files found in the `analyses/` directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed. This means that analysts can use dbt functionality like `{{ ref(...) }}` to select from models in an environment-agnostic way.==

In practice, an analysis file might look like this (via the [open source Quickbooks models](https://github.com/dbt-labs/quickbooks)):

analyses/running_total_by_account.sql

``` sql
-- analyses/running_total_by_account.sql

with journal_entries as (

  select *
  from {{ ref('quickbooks_adjusted_journal_entries') }}

), accounts as (

  select *
  from {{ ref('quickbooks_accounts_transformed') }}

)

select
  txn_date,
  account_id,
  adjusted_amount,
  description,
  account_name,
  sum(adjusted_amount) over (partition by account_id order by id rows unbounded preceding)
from journal_entries
order by account_id, id
```

To compile this analysis into runnable sql, run:

``` bash
dbt compile
```

Then, look for the compiled SQL file in ==`target/compiled/{project name}/analyses/running_total_by_account.sql`.== This sql can then be pasted into a data visualization tool, for instance. ==Note that no `running_total_by_account` relation will be materialized in the database as this is an `analysis`, not a `model`.==


## Snapshots Overview
https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row
### What are snapshots?

Analysts often need to "look back in time" at previous data states in their mutable tables. While some source data systems are built in a way that makes accessing historical data possible, this is not always the case. dbt provides a mechanism, **snapshots**, which records changes to a mutable [table](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/table) over time.

Snapshots implement [type-2 Slowly Changing Dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row) over mutable source tables. These Slowly Changing Dimensions (or SCDs) identify how a row in a table changes over time. Imagine you have an `orders` table where the `status` field can be overwritten as the order is processed.

|id|status|updated_at|
|---|---|---|
|1|pending|2019-01-01|

Now, imagine that the order goes from "pending" to "shipped". That same record will now look like:

|id|status|updated_at|
|---|---|---|
|1|shipped|2019-01-02|

This order is now in the "shipped" state, but we've lost the information about when the order was last in the "pending" state. This makes it difficult (or impossible) to analyze how long it took for an order to ship. dbt can "snapshot" these changes to help you understand how values in a row change over time. Here's an example of a snapshot table for the previous example:

|id|status|updated_at|dbt_valid_from|dbt_valid_to|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|pending|2019-01-01|2019-01-01|2019-01-02|
|1|shipped|2019-01-02|2019-01-02|`null`|
