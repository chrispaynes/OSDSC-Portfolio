> I'll shy away from giving a firm answer, but at the end of the day documentation is there to help people using your project to know what the fields mean, and what the tables are there to accomplish. Those people include the developers in the project. Even if your end users don't see the plumbing, the data team does, and it can be helpful to have documentation there to avoid having to decipher the code constantly.That being said, adding documentation takes time, so having a hard-and-fast rule that says every column has to have a description might be prohibitive to your work. There is always a trade-off between time spent documenting and time spent answering questions because you didn't document something. You can always go back later and add documentation if you keep getting asked the same question on specific tables/columns. You can't get back the time you spent documenting something that people may never look at.My personal recommendation (not speaking for dbt Labs here) would be to document your sources, document any particularly complex/confusing logic in your intermediate layer, and document your mart layer. IMO there's no need to copy/paste the same description from the staging layer through every model to the marts layer if that column is never transformed.
