# Marts: Business-defined entities

- **Materialized as tables or incremental models.**
	- Once we reach the marts layer, it’s time to start building not just our logic into the warehouse, but the data itself. This gives end users much faster performance for these later models that are actually designed for their use, and saves us costs recomputing these entire chains of models every time somebody refreshes a dashboard or runs a regression in python. ==A good general rule of thumb regarding materialization is to always start with a view (as it takes up essentially no storage and always gives you up-to-date results), once that view takes too long to practically _query_, build it into a table, and finally once that table takes too long to _build_ and is slowing down your runs, [configure it as an incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models/). As always, start simple and only add complexity as necessary.== The models with the most data and compute-intensive transformations should absolutely take advantage of dbt’s excellent incremental materialization options, but rushing to make all your marts models incremental by default will introduce superfluous difficulty. We recommend reading this [classic post from Tristan on the limits of incremental modeling](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303).
- **Build on separate marts thoughtfully.**
	- ==While we strive to preserve a narrowing DAG up to the marts layer, once here things may start to get a little less strict. A common example is passing information between marts at different grains, as we saw above, where we bring our `orders` mart into our `customers` marts to aggregate critical order data into a `customer` grain. Now that we’re really ‘spending’ compute and storage by actually building the data in our outputs, it’s sensible to leverage previously built resources to speed up and save costs on outputs that require similar data, versus recomputing the same views and CTEs from scratch. The right approach here is heavily dependent on your unique DAG, models, and goals — it’s just important to note that using a mart in building another, later mart is okay, but requires careful consideration to avoid wasted resources or circular dependencies.==
