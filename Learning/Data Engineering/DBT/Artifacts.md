DBT (Data Build Tool) artifacts ==refer to the various files and assets that are produced as a result of running DBT commands and executing your data transformation workflows. These artifacts are essential for the organization, documentation, and reproducibility of your data pipelines and analytics projects.== The key DBT artifacts include:

1. **DBT Models**: DBT models are SQL files that define the data transformations applied to your raw data sources. Each DBT model represents a specific data object, such as a table, view, or materialized view. These SQL files are typically stored in your DBT project's `models` directory.

2. **DBT Macros**: DBT macros are reusable SQL code snippets that can be invoked within your models. Macros simplify the process of writing and maintaining SQL code for common tasks. They are stored in the `macros` directory of your DBT project.

3. **DBT Snapshots**: Snapshots are custom checkpoints or copies of your DBT project at specific points in time. You can create snapshots to capture the state of your project's codebase and configurations, which can be valuable for auditing, testing, and historical tracking.

4. **DBT Documentation**: DBT allows you to document your models, tests, columns, and macros. Documentation is stored in `.yml` files and is used to describe the purpose and characteristics of different components of your project.

5. **DBT Configuration Files**: The DBT configuration files include the `dbt_project.yml` file, which defines project-level configurations, and the `profiles.yml` file, which specifies the connection details for your data warehouses. These files are crucial for managing and running DBT projects.

6. **DBT Compiled SQL Files**: When you run the `dbt compile` command, DBT compiles your SQL models into optimized SQL code that can be executed against your data warehouse. These compiled SQL files are stored in the `.dbt/run` directory.

7. **DBT Target Files**: The `target` directory contains files that specify how your DBT project should connect to your data warehouse and execute SQL commands.

8. **DBT Logs**: DBT generates logs that capture the results of your DBT commands and executions. These logs provide information about the success or failure of your data transformations and tests.

9. **DBT Snapshots and Checkpoints**: These custom snapshots or checkpoints capture the state of your project's code and configurations at specific points in time, facilitating version control and historical tracking.

10. **DBT Compiled Macros**: When you run DBT macros, they are compiled into SQL code for execution. The compiled macro code is stored in the `.dbt/run` directory.

11. **DBT Tests and Test Results**: DBT tests are defined in your models to ensure data quality and adherence to business rules. Test results are generated when you run tests and indicate whether the data passes or fails the defined criteria.

These DBT artifacts are essential for maintaining a well-organized and documented data transformation project. They enable reproducibility, collaboration, and effective management of your data pipelines and analytics workflows. Additionally, these artifacts are often version-controlled using tools like Git to track changes, facilitate collaboration, and ensure data operations compliance.
