OpenSearch, which is an open-source search and analytics platform, provides a variety of query operators that allow you to construct complex search queries for retrieving data from an OpenSearch index. These operators are used in query strings to specify search criteria and control how the search is performed. Here are some of the commonly used query operators in OpenSearch:

1. **Match Operator (`match`):** The `match` operator is used to perform full-text search. It matches documents that contain the specified search terms. For example:
   
   ```
   match: {
     field_name: "search_term"
   }
   ```

2. **Match Phrase Operator (`match_phrase`):** The `match_phrase` operator searches for documents that contain an exact phrase. For example:

   ```
   match_phrase: {
     field_name: "exact phrase"
   }
   ```

3. **Range Operator (`range`):** The `range` operator is used to specify a range of values for a field. It can be used for date ranges, numeric ranges, and more. For example:

   ```
   range: {
     date_field: {
       gte: "2023-01-01",
       lte: "2023-12-31"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Wildcard Operator (`wildcard`):** The `wildcard` operator allows you to perform wildcard searches using `*` and `?` as placeholders. For example:

   ```
   wildcard: {
     field_name: "wild*card?"
   }
   ```

5. **Prefix Operator (`prefix`):** The `prefix` operator matches documents where a field starts with a specified prefix. For example:

   ```
   prefix: {
     field_name: "prefix"
   }
   ```

6. **Exists Operator (`exists`):** The `exists` operator checks whether a field exists in a document. For example:

   ```
   exists: {
     field: "field_name"
   }
   ```

7. **Bool Operator (`bool`):** The `bool` operator allows you to combine multiple query operators using Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT). For example:

   ```
   bool: {
     must: [{ match: { field1: "value1" } }],
     should: [{ match: { field2: "value2" } }],
     must_not: [{ match: { field3: "value3" } }]
   }
   ```

8. **Term Operator (`term`):** The `term` operator is used for exact matches. It matches documents where a field has an exact value. For example:

   ```
   term: {
     field_name: "exact_value"
   }
   ```

9. **Fuzzy Operator (`fuzzy`):** The `fuzzy` operator performs fuzzy matching to find documents that are similar to a specified term. It allows for a certain degree of spelling or typographical errors. For example:

   ```
   fuzzy: {
     field_name: {
       value: "fuzzy_value",
       fuzziness: "AUTO"
     }
   }
   ```

10. **Regexp Operator (`regexp`):** The `regexp` operator allows you to perform regular expression-based searches. For example:

    ```
    regexp: {
      field_name: "regex_pattern"
    }
    ```

These are some of the common query operators in OpenSearch, but there are many more available for various use cases. The choice of operator depends on the specific search requirements and data structure of your index. You can combine and nest these operators to create complex and precise search queries. Be sure to refer to the OpenSearch documentation for a comprehensive list of operators and their usage.
