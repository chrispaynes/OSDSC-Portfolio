==Inverse trigonometric functions are functions that "reverse" the action of trigonometric functions. While trigonometric functions take an angle as input and output a corresponding ratio (such as sine, cosine, tangent, etc.), inverse trigonometric functions take a ratio as input and output the corresponding angle.==

The common inverse trigonometric functions include:

1. **Inverse Sine Function (Arcsine):**
   - Denoted as $\sin^{-1}(x)$ or $\arcsin(x)$
   - Defined for $x$ in the range $[-1, 1]$
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\sin(\theta) = x$

2. **Inverse Cosine Function (Arccosine):**
   - Denoted as $\cos^{-1}(x)$ or $\arccos(x)$
   - Defined for $x$ in the range $[-1, 1]$
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\cos(\theta) = x$

3. **Inverse Tangent Function (Arctangent):**
   - Denoted as $\tan^{-1}(x)$ or $\arctan(x)$
   - Defined for all real numbers
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\tan(\theta) = x$

4. **Inverse Cotangent Function (Arccotangent):**
   - Denoted as $\cot^{-1}(x)$ or $\text{arccot}(x)$
   - Defined for all real numbers except 0
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\cot(\theta) = x$

5. **Inverse Secant Function (Arcsecant):**
   - Denoted as $\sec^{-1}(x)$ or $\text{arcsec}(x)$
   - Defined for $x$ in the range $(- \infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\sec(\theta) = x$

6. **Inverse Cosecant Function (Arccosecant):**
   - Denoted as $\csc^{-1}(x)$ or $\text{arccsc}(x)$
   - Defined for $x$ in the range $(- \infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$
   - The output is an angle $\theta$ such that $\csc(\theta) = x$

These functions are used when solving trigonometric equations or when the angle needs to be determined based on a given ratio. The domains of these functions are carefully chosen to ensure that they are one-to-one functions, allowing for a unique angle to be associated with a given ratio.
