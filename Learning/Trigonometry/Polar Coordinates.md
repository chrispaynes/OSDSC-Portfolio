Polar coordinates are a ==system for representing points in a plane using a distance (radius) from a reference point (pole) and an angle measured from a reference direction (usually the positive x-axis). In trigonometry, polar coordinates provide an alternative way to describe the location of a point compared to the more common Cartesian coordinates (x, y).==

A point in polar coordinates is represented as (r, θ), where:
- $r$ is the distance from the pole to the point, known as the radius.
- $\theta$ is the angle measured counterclockwise from the reference direction to the line segment connecting the pole and the point.

Converting between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, θ) involves the following relationships:
$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$

Conversely,
$x = r \cdot \cos(\theta)$
$y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)$

==Polar coordinates are particularly useful for describing circular and rotational motion, as well as in situations where a radial distance and angular direction are more intuitive than Cartesian coordinates.==
