==The sum and difference formulas in trigonometry are relationships that express the trigonometric functions of the sum or difference of two angles in terms of the trigonometric functions of the individual angles.== 

==These formulas are useful for simplifying expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and analyzing trigonometric identities.==

The sum and difference formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent are as follows:

1. **Sum and Difference Formulas for Sine:**
   - Sum Formula: $\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$
   - Difference Formula: $\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B$

2. **Sum and Difference Formulas for Cosine:**
   - Sum Formula: $\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$
   - Difference Formula: $\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B$

3. **Sum and Difference Formulas for Tangent:**
   - Sum Formula: $\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$
   - Difference Formula: $\tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}$

Here, $A$ and $B$ represent angles, and $\sin A$, $\cos A$, and $\tan A$ are the sine, cosine, and tangent of angle $A$, respectively. Similarly, $\sin B$, $\cos B$, and $\tan B$ are the corresponding trigonometric functions of angle $B$.

These formulas are derived using trigonometric identities and properties, and they provide a way to express the trigonometric functions of the sum or difference of angles in terms of the functions of the individual angles. The sum and difference formulas are foundational in trigonometry and are widely used in various mathematical and scientific applications.
