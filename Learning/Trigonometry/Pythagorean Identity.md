==The Pythagorean identity is a fundamental trigonometric identity that relates the values of the three main trigonometric functions—sine ($\sin$), cosine ($\cos$), and tangent ($\tan$)—for any angle in a right-angled triangle. ==

==The Pythagorean identity is based on the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$):==

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$

The Pythagorean identity is expressed as:

$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$

Here:
- $\sin(\theta)$ is the sine of the angle $\theta$.
- $\cos(\theta)$ is the cosine of the angle $\theta$.
- $\theta$ is the angle in the right-angled triangle.

==This identity highlights the relationship between the sine and cosine functions in terms of the Pythagorean theorem. It implies that for any angle $\theta$, the square of the sine of that angle plus the square of the cosine of that angle is always equal to 1.==

==The Pythagorean identity is a fundamental tool in trigonometry and is used in various mathematical derivations and applications. It is a key building block for understanding the relationships between trigonometric functions and is often employed in solving trigonometric equations and problems.==
