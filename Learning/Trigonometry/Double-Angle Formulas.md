==The double-angle formulas in trigonometry express the trigonometric functions of twice an angle in terms of the trigonometric functions of the original angle. These formulas are useful for simplifying trigonometric expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and proving certain trigonometric identities.==

The double-angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent are as follows:

1. **Double-Angle Formulas for Sine:**
   $\sin(2A) = 2 \sin A \cos A$

2. **Double-Angle Formulas for Cosine:**
   $\cos(2A) = \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A = 2 \cos^2 A - 1 = 1 - 2 \sin^2 A$

3. **Double-Angle Formula for Tangent:**
   $\tan(2A) = \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}$

These formulas are derived from the sum formulas for sine and cosine by setting $A = B$ in those formulas. The double-angle formulas provide relationships between the trigonometric functions of an angle and those of twice the angle.

These formulas have various applications, including simplifying expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and proving trigonometric identities. ==They are also used in calculus and physics for integrating or differentiating functions involving trigonometric terms.== The double-angle formulas play a crucial role in trigonometry and are fundamental tools in the analysis of periodic functions and angles.
