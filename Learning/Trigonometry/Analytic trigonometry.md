Analytic trigonometry is a ==branch of mathematics that applies algebraic and geometric methods to analyze trigonometric functions and their properties. It involves using algebraic techniques to manipulate and simplify trigonometric expressions and employing geometric concepts to understand the relationships between angles and their corresponding trigonometric values.== Analytic trigonometry extends the study of trigonometric functions beyond the basic definitions and explores their behavior, identities, and applications.

Key aspects of analytic trigonometry include:

1. **Trigonometric Identities:** Analytic trigonometry involves proving and applying various trigonometric identities. These identities express relationships between different trigonometric functions and are fundamental tools for simplifying expressions and solving equations.

2. **Trigonometric Equations:** Analytic techniques are used to solve equations involving trigonometric functions. These solutions often require the application of identities and the manipulation of trigonometric expressions.

3. **Trigonometric Functions of Angles:** Analytic methods are employed to analyze the behavior of trigonometric functions for specific angles, as well as to extend their definitions to real numbers through the unit circle.

4. **Graphs of Trigonometric Functions:** Analytic trigonometry includes the study of the graphs of trigonometric functions. This involves understanding the periodic nature of sine and cosine functions, as well as the effects of amplitude, frequency, and phase shifts.

5. **Applications:** Analytic trigonometry finds applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and signal processing. It is used to model periodic phenomena, analyze waveforms, and solve problems involving angles and rotations.

Overall, analytic trigonometry provides a powerful set of tools for understanding and working with trigonometric functions analytically, complementing the geometric interpretations associated with the unit circle and triangles.
