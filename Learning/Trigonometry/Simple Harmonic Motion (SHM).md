Harmonic motion, often referred to as simple harmonic motion (SHM), is ==a type of periodic motion that can be described by trigonometric functions, particularly the sine and cosine functions. It is a repetitive and oscillatory motion commonly observed in various natural phenomena, such as the motion of a swinging pendulum, the vibration of a guitar string, or the oscillation of a mass-spring system.==

==In trigonometry, the displacement (position) of an object undergoing harmonic motion can be expressed as a sinusoidal function of time.==

The general form of the displacement function for simple harmonic motion is given by:

$x(t) = A \cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi)$

Here:
- $x(t)$ is the displacement of the object at time $t$.
- $A$ is the amplitude, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency ($f$) by the equation $\omega = 2\pi f$.
- $\phi$ is the phase angle, indicating the initial position of the object at $t = 0$.

The cosine function is commonly used, but the sine function can also be used, and the choice depends on the initial conditions of the motion.

==Harmonic motion is characterized by its periodic nature, with the object repeatedly moving back and forth around a central or equilibrium position. The angular frequency determines how quickly the oscillations occur, while the amplitude represents the maximum displacement from the equilibrium. The phase angle accounts for the initial conditions, determining the starting position of the motion.==
