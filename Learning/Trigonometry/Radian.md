A radian is a unit of measurement for angles. It is defined as the angle subtended when you travel along the circumference of a circle, covering an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. In more formal terms, ==one radian is the angle formed when the arc length is equal to the radius.==

The symbol for radians is "rad," and angles measured in radians are often denoted without any unit label. For example, an angle of 45 degrees can also be expressed as $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians.

The relationship between degrees and radians is based on the fact that a complete circle corresponds to $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians. Therefore, to convert from degrees to radians, you can use the conversion factor $\frac{\pi}{180}$ since $180^\circ$ is equivalent to $\pi$ radians.

The advantage of using radians in mathematical and trigonometric calculations is that many formulas and relationships involving circular motion and trigonometry become simpler when angles are measured in radians. The radian measure is particularly common in calculus, physics, and engineering contexts.
