==Parametric equations are a set of equations that express the coordinates of a point in terms of one or more independent variables, often referred to as parameters. In trigonometry, parametric equations are frequently used to describe curves and motions using trigonometric functions.== 

The parametric equations for a point $(x, y)$ in the Cartesian plane are given by:

$x = f(t)$
$y = g(t)$

Here, $t$ is the parameter, and $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are functions that define the relationships between the coordinates and the parameter.

In the context of trigonometry, parametric equations often involve sine and cosine functions. For example, the parametric equations for a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin are given by:

$x = r \cdot \cos(t)$
$y = r \cdot \sin(t)$

Here, $t$ is the parameter, and as $t$ varies, the point $(x, y)$ traces out the circular path.

==Parametric equations offer a flexible way to represent complex curves and motions, allowing for a more intuitive description of the relationship between the variables. ==They are widely used in various branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering to model a wide range of phenomena, including trigonometric functions and geometric shapes.
