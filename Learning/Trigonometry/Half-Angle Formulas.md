==The half-angle formulas in trigonometry express the trigonometric functions of an angle half the size of a given angle in terms of the trigonometric functions of the original angle.==

==These formulas are useful for simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving certain trigonometric equations. ==

The half-angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent are as follows:

1. **Half-Angle Formulas for Sine:**
   - For any angle $A$:
     $\sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{2}}$
   - The choice of the positive or negative square root depends on the quadrant in which $A/2$ lies.

2. **Half-Angle Formulas for Cosine:**
   - For any angle $A$:
     $\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}$
   - The choice of the positive or negative square root depends on the quadrant in which $A/2$ lies.

3. **Half-Angle Formula for Tangent:**
   - For any angle $A$ where $\cos A \neq 0$:
     $\tan\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{1 + \cos A}}$
   - The choice of the positive or negative square root depends on the sign of $\tan(A/2)$.

These formulas are derived from the double-angle formulas by solving for the half-angle. It's important to consider the sign of the result based on the quadrant of the original angle.

==The half-angle formulas are particularly useful in calculus, where they can be applied to integrate or differentiate expressions involving trigonometric functions. ==They are also employed in various branches of science and engineering for analyzing periodic phenomena.
