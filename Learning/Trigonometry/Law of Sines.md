The Law of Sines, also known as the Sine Law or Sine Rule, is a trigonometric equation relating the sides and angles of any triangle. It states that, in a triangle:

$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$

Here:
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides opposite to the angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the measures of the angles opposite to the sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.

==The Law of Sines can be helpful in solving triangles when you know the following:==
1. ==Two angles and a side (not the one between the given angles).==
2. ==Two sides and an angle (not included by the sides).==

==The Law of Sines is particularly useful for solving triangles that are not right-angled, and it provides a relationship between the angles and sides in such triangles.==
