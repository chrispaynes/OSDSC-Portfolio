==Trigonometric functions are mathematical functions that relate angles in a right-angled triangle. The most common trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, and tangent==, denoted as $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$, respectively, where $\theta$ represents an angle.

1. **Sine Function ($\sin(\theta)$):**
   - In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - ==Use-case: Sine functions are widely used in physics, engineering, and signal processing to model periodic phenomena, such as oscillations and waves.==

2. **Cosine Function ($\cos(\theta)$):**
   - The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - Use-case: Cosine functions also play a significant role in modeling periodic phenomena and are often used in applications like physics, engineering, and signal processing.

3. **Tangent Function ($\tan(\theta)$):**
   - The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.
   - Use-case: Tangent functions are used in trigonometry and have applications in geometry, physics, engineering, and navigation.

==These basic trigonometric functions are extended to other related functions, including cosecant ($\csc(\theta)$), secant ($\sec(\theta)$), and cotangent ($\cot(\theta)$), which are the reciprocals of sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively.==

Other important trigonometric concepts and identities include the Pythagorean identity, sum and difference formulas, double-angle formulas, and half-angle formulas.

Trigonometric functions are essential in fields such as physics, engineering, computer graphics, and astronomy, where they are used to model and analyze periodic phenomena, angles, and rotations. They are also fundamental in calculus and mathematical analysis.
