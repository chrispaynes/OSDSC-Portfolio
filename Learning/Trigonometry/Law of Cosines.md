The Law of Cosines, also known as the Cosine Law, is another ==trigonometric equation that relates the sides and angles of a triangle. It is particularly useful for solving triangles when you have information about the lengths of the sides and the measures of one or more angles.== 

The Law of Cosines states that, for any triangle:

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C)$

Here:
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
- $C$ is the measure of the angle opposite to side $c$.

==This law is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem and can be used in various scenarios. Depending on the information you have, you can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of a side or the measure of an angle in a triangle. The Law of Cosines is particularly useful for solving triangles that are not right-angled.==
