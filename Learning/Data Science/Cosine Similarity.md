As the head of data science, understanding cosine similarity is crucial for various applications in text analysis and information retrieval. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space, providing a metric for similarity ranging from -1 (exactly opposite) to 1 (exactly the same), with 0 indicating orthogonality or no correlation.

In text matching, vectors _A_ and _B_ often represent term frequency vectors of documents. Cosine similarity is particularly useful for normalizing document length, ensuring that comparisons are not biased by document size. In information retrieval, cosine similarity values typically range from 0 to 1, as term frequencies are non-negative. This property holds true even when using TF-IDF weights, as the angle between term frequency vectors cannot exceed 90 degrees. This makes cosine similarity a powerful tool for comparing document similarity in a normalized manner, facilitating effective search and retrieval operations.
