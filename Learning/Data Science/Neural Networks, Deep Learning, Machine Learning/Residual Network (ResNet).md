ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a ==type of deep neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of training very deep networks.== It was introduced by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in their paper titled "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition," presented at the 2016 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

==The key innovation in ResNet is the use of residual blocks, which include shortcut connections or skip connections. These connections allow the network to learn residual functions rather than the actual desired underlying mappings. The idea is to make it easier for the network to learn the identity mapping, and the residual functions are then added to this identity.==

Here are some key features of ResNet:

1. **Residual Blocks:**
   - The basic building block of a ResNet is the residual block.
   - Each block consists of a series of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations.
   - The output of the block is the sum of the input to the block and the output of the block itself.

2. **Skip Connections:**
   - Skip connections, also known as shortcut connections, enable the gradient to flow more easily during backpropagation.
   - The skip connections directly connect the input of a residual block to its output, creating a shortcut path.

3. **Deeper Networks:**
   - ResNet architectures can be much deeper than traditional architectures without suffering from vanishing gradient problems.
   - The skip connections help in mitigating the degradation problem, where adding more layers to a network can result in a decrease in accuracy.

4. **Residual Learning:**
   - Instead of trying to learn the desired mapping directly, ResNet focuses on learning the residuals (differences) between the input and output.
   - This makes it easier for the network to learn identity mappings, which helps in training deeper networks.

5. **Prevalent in Image Classification:**
   - ResNet architectures have been particularly successful in image classification tasks.
   - They have been used in various competitions, including the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, where deeper ResNet variants achieved state-of-the-art performance.

ResNet architectures come in various depths, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, with the number indicating the total number of layers in the network. The skip connections in ResNet have since become a common architectural element in many deep neural network designs.
