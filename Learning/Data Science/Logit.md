The term "logit" has two related but distinct meanings, one in the field of logistic regression and the other in the context of probability theory:

1. **Logit in Logistic Regression:**
   - In logistic regression, the ==logit function is used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable (usually coded as 0 or 1) and one or more independent variables. The logistic function is the inverse of the logit function.==
   - ==The logit function (log-odds) is defined as the natural logarithm of the odds of the probability of the event happening (e.g., the probability of a binary outcome being 1). It transforms the linear combination of predictors in logistic regression to a range between negative infinity and positive infinity.==
   - Mathematically, the logit function is denoted as:
     $\text{logit}(p) = \ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$
     where $p$ is the probability of the event.

2. **Logit in Probability Theory:**
   - ==In probability theory, the term "logit" is used more broadly to refer to the logarithm of the odds. It is a mathematical transformation that maps probabilities to the real number line.==
   - ==The logit function is particularly useful when dealing with probabilities, as it transforms the open interval (0, 1) to the entire real line. The inverse of the logit function is the logistic function, which maps real numbers back to the (0, 1) interval.==

In both cases, the logit function plays a key role in modeling the relationship between probabilities and predictor variables, making it a fundamental concept in logistic regression and probability theory.
