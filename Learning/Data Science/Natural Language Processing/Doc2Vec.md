Doc2Vec, or Paragraph Vector, is an extension of the Word2Vec model designed to learn fixed-size vector representations for variable-length pieces of text, such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents. Developed by researchers at Google, including Tomas Mikolov, in a paper titled "Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents" in 2014, Doc2Vec provides a means to generate dense vector representations for entire documents while capturing their semantic content.

Key concepts of Doc2Vec:

1. **Paragraph Vectors**: In Doc2Vec, each document is represented by a unique vector, often referred to as a "paragraph vector" or "doc vector." These vectors are learned during the training process and aim to capture the semantic meaning of the document.

2. **PV-DM (Distributed Memory) Model**: Similar to the Word2Vec architectures, Doc2Vec has two main models: PV-DM and PV-DBOW.

   - **PV-DM**: In this model, the document vector acts as a memory that is shared across all words in a given context. The model predicts the next word in a context window based on both the document vector and the words in the window.

3. **PV-DBOW (Distributed Bag of Words) Model**: In this model, the task is simplified to predicting words based solely on the document vector. The model predicts words independently, without considering the order in which they appear.

4. **Training Process**: During training, the model learns to predict words within a context window given the document vector. The document vector is updated to maximize the likelihood of predicting words accurately.

5. **Vector Similarity**: Doc2Vec allows measuring semantic similarity between documents by computing the cosine similarity between their respective paragraph vectors. This similarity can be useful for tasks such as document clustering, information retrieval, and document ranking.

6. **Inferencing New Documents**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to infer paragraph vectors for new, unseen documents. This allows leveraging the knowledge learned during training for new documents.

7. **Hyperparameters**: Doc2Vec has hyperparameters such as vector dimensionality, context window size, and the number of training epochs that can be tuned for optimal performance.

Doc2Vec has been applied in various natural language processing tasks, including document classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. It is particularly useful when dealing with documents of varying lengths and structures, providing a means to obtain dense, continuous representations for entire textual content.
