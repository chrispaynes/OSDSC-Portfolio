## Preface

## 1. Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking

> There is a fundamental structure to data-analytic thinking, and basic principles that should be understood. There are also particular areas where intuition, creativity, common sense, and domain knowledge must be brought to bear.

> At a high level, data science is a set of fundamental principles that guide the extraction of knowledge from data. Data mining is the extraction of knowledge from data, via technologies that incorporate these principles.

> you should be able to assess the proposal systematically and decide whether it is sound or flawed. This does not mean that you will be able to tell whether it will actually succeed — for data mining projects, that often requires trying — but you should be able to spot obvious flaws, unrealistic assumptions, and missing pieces.

> It would be more valuable to discover patterns due to the hurricane that were not obvious.
