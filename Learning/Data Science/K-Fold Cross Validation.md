K-Fold Cross Validation is a widely used technique in machine learning for assessing the performance and generalization ability of a model. The basic idea behind K-Fold Cross Validation is to divide the dataset into K subsets (folds) and then iteratively train and evaluate the model K times, using a different fold as the test set in each iteration while the remaining K-1 folds are used for training.

Here's the general process of K-Fold Cross Validation:

1. **Dataset Splitting**: The original dataset is randomly divided into K equal-sized folds. Each fold is used exactly once as a validation while the K-1 remaining folds form the training set.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the validation set exactly once.

3. **Performance Metrics Aggregation**: The performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) obtained in each iteration are averaged or otherwise aggregated to provide a single performance estimate for the model.

4. **Robustness Assessment**: K-Fold Cross Validation helps in assessing the robustness of the model by providing an estimate of its performance across different subsets of the data. It helps identify whether the model's performance is consistent or if it varies significantly based on the specific data used for training and testing.

Common choices for K in K-Fold Cross Validation are 5 or 10, but the value of K can be adjusted based on the size of the dataset and computational resources. The process is often referred to as "K-Fold Cross Validation" or simply "K-Fold CV."

Benefits of K-Fold Cross Validation:

- Provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train-test split.
- Reduces the impact of the data split on the assessment of model performance.
- Helps identify potential issues with overfitting or underfitting.

Keep in mind that K-Fold Cross Validation does not replace the need for a separate test set that is not used during model development. The test set is typically reserved for final model evaluation after hyperparameter tuning and model selection based on cross-validation results.
