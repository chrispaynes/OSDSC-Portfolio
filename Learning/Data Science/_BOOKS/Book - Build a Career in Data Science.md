### 9.5 Interview with Jarvis Miller, data scientist at Spotify

#### What were some things that surprised you in your first data science job?

#### What are some issues you faced?

#### Can you tell us about one of your first projects?

#### What would be your biggest piece of advice for the first few months?

### ==Summary==
- you wont have knowledge of your predecessor
- ask questions early to test your approach before diving in
- learn about the process vs the result and rhythm of peers
- learn which programming languages and how to structure an analysis
- work on building your own processes
- meet with manager to figure out priorities
- don't assume creating a highly accurate model is your biggest priority and your success metric
	- usefulness, level of insight, maintainability are often more important
- don't guess what is wanted from manager and peers, ask and get feedback
- figure out Data Science performance matrix and define success
- learn about the company's data, previous reports, KPIs and analysis communication style
	- repo of reports to stakeholders
	- ask about data nuances you find and understand the shape, summary states, attributes, pipeline and lineage of the company's data
	- make a map of where things live
- deliver value over the long term, don't stress about providing substances value immediately (first 6 months) 
- focus on simple and descriptive questions - example: what is the distribution of client sizes? what percentage of clients make a second purchase? how many people click emails? 
	- this prevents overwhelming yourself with a complicated question that may result in a poor initial analysis/project
- ==your job as a DS is to dig into the business question to find the data question behind it==
- expedite your productivity by asking questions and building relationships
	- use the right communication channel to ask questions (can ask your manager how to ask questions)
	- if you have a lot of questions of 1 person, set up a meeting as opposed to messaging them every few minutes
	- understand the context behind the technical/legacy decisions
	- see how people find answers
- get to know people outside of technical questions, can set up meetings
	- ask manager if there's a list of people to get to know better or meet
	- make yourself know to your boss's boss, peers and stakeholders — make it known you exist outside of slack and email
	- use questions as a way to start conversation
- make sure to communicate with people even when you don't need something from them — don't make people feel used
- as the first data scientist, you set the precedent for future data scientists — think carefully
	- ==you'll have to sell your role to people unfamiliar with your new position and set expectations — don't silo yourself==
	- ==make people understand the limitations of DS and the fact that it's not magic==
- ask data scientists outside of your company if they think you're in the appropriate work environment
- stakeholders that have worked with Data Scientists before don't necessarily know, understand or internalize DS
- ==understand when you're blocked and feel empowered to voice an opinion==

## 10 Making an effective analysis

### 10.1 The request


### 10.2 The analysis plan


### 10.3 Doing the analysis

#### 10.3.1 Importing and cleaning data

#### 10.3.2 Data exploration and modeling

#### 10.3.3 Important points for exploring and modeling


### 10.4 Wrapping it up

#### 10.4.1 Final presentation

#### 10.4.2 Mothballing your work


### 10.5 Interview with Hilary Parker, data scientist at Stitch Fix

#### How does thinking about other people help your analysis?

#### How do you structure your analyses?

#### What kind of polish do you do in the final version?

#### How do you handle people asking for adjustments to an analysis?

### Summary
- Analyses are generally a 1 time output that focus on a single takeway
- Reports are recurring and focus more on charts, and numbers
- Properties of Good Analyses:
	- directly answers the original question — or indicates there is not enough data
	- are completed quickly/timely while the data and the need is still fresh and relevant
	- is shareable and is self contained
	- can be explained on its own (doesn't refer to other work) and includes all necessary context
	- can be revisited in the future
- ==Must convert the business question into a DS questions, answer the DS question and turn it into a business response==
	- find the motive behind the question — make sure someone isn't just curious
	- find the question
	- find what decision will be made
	- ==do we have the required data?==
	- have a kickoff meeting
	- 
- When answering a simple business question — the goal is to answer the question in a way the stakeholder will understand
	- not create the highest tuned model
	- more complicated methods are harder to setup, debug, maintain and explain
	- choose the simplest method, it's easiest to trust
	- instead of pruning outliers, take the Log Transformation or the median instead of the mean
- Check in with stakeholder to ensure you're still on the right analysis track
	- maintain a continual level of polish in your notebook so it's readily shareable
- Create an Analysis Plan (guardrail to ensure you're doing relevant work)
	- write down everything you plan to do with the data
	- as you're working, track and make sure you stick to the plan
	- make the plan actionable with specific steps as opposed to "figure out xyz data aspect"
	- we strongly recommend using the following template:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240211160726.png]]
		- **The top** List the title of the analysis, who you are (in case the analysis will be shared with others), and the objective of the analysis.
		- **Sections:** Each section should be a general topic in the analysis. The analysis work done within each section should be self-contained (not relying on the work of other sections), so it should be possible for a different person to do each section. Each section should have a list of tasks.
		- First level of section lists The first level of the section lists should be each question that was posed. This section will help everyone remember why you’re doing that specific work, and if all the questions are successfully answered, the topic of the main section should be considered to be understood.
		- **Second level of section lists** The second level of the lists should have the actual tasks to do that can be checked off as the work is being done. These tasks could be types of models to run, for example, and the descriptions should be specific enough so that at any time, you could concretely say whether the work has been completed.
- Deliver analysis in person
	- discuss what you did, learned and chose not to look into
	- be prepared for questions and skepticisms (this data doesn't align w/ expectations or other report/data)
	- it's OK to say you need to look into something and don't know something
	- as a DS, you'll have the best chance of know what "followup analysis" will be valuable
- ==Before moving onto the next project, document your work==
	- double check that you can easily re-run the entire analysis
	- comment code as a refresher
	- add a README file (cover what analysis is, why it was done and how to run it)
	- store the code in Github
	- ensure the data is retained and stored in DB's and not on laptop
	- export the output for archival
- Read your audience while you're presenting — scale back on the fly when needed
- Don't make complicated visuals, consumers can't digest quickly
- Keep a clean notebook (w/o comments) that shows only the outcome when presenting
	- have an appendix to show where the analysis started
	- focus on the final format when writing the code
	- use your companie's color branding when it makes sense
- Your value add as a DS is to help stakeholder frame the problem
