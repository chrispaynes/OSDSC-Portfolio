#### What would be your biggest piece of advice for the first few months?

### ==Summary==
- you wont have knowledge of your predecessor
- ask questions early to test your approach before diving in
- learn about the process vs the result and rhythm of peers
- learn which programming languages and how to structure an analysis
- work on building your own processes
- meet with manager to figure out priorities
- don't assume creating a highly accurate model is your biggest priority and your success metric
	- usefulness, level of insight, maintainability are often more important
- don't guess what is wanted from manager and peers, ask and get feedback
- figure out Data Science performance matrix and define success
- learn about the company's data, previous reports, KPIs and analysis communication style
	- repo of reports to stakeholders
	- ask about data nuances you find and understand the shape, summary states, attributes, pipeline and lineage of the company's data
	- make a map of where things live
- deliver value over the long term, don't stress about providing substances value immediately (first 6 months) 
- focus on simple and descriptive questions - example: what is the distribution of client sizes? what percentage of clients make a second purchase? how many people click emails? 
	- this prevents overwhelming yourself with a complicated question that may result in a poor initial analysis/project
- ==your job as a DS is to dig into the business question to find the data question behind it==
- expedite your productivity by asking questions and building relationships
	- use the right communication channel to ask questions (can ask your manager how to ask questions)
	- if you have a lot of questions of 1 person, set up a meeting as opposed to messaging them every few minutes
	- understand the context behind the technical/legacy decisions
	- see how people find answers
- get to know people outside of technical questions, can set up meetings
	- ask manager if there's a list of people to get to know better or meet
	- make yourself know to your boss's boss, peers and stakeholders — make it known you exist outside of slack and email
	- use questions as a way to start conversation
- make sure to communicate with people even when you don't need something from them — don't make people feel used
- as the first data scientist, you set the precedent for future data scientists — think carefully
	- ==you'll have to sell your role to people unfamiliar with your new position and set expectations — don't silo yourself==
	- ==make people understand the limitations of DS and the fact that it's not magic==
- ask data scientists outside of your company if they think you're in the appropriate work environment
- stakeholders that have worked with Data Scientists before don't necessarily know, understand or internalize DS
- ==understand when you're blocked and feel empowered to voice an opinion==

## 10 Making an effective analysis

### 10.1 The request


### 10.2 The analysis plan


### 10.3 Doing the analysis

#### 10.3.1 Importing and cleaning data

#### 10.3.2 Data exploration and modeling

#### 10.3.3 Important points for exploring and modeling


### 10.4 Wrapping it up

#### 10.4.1 Final presentation

#### 10.4.2 Mothballing your work


### 10.5 Interview with Hilary Parker, data scientist at Stitch Fix

#### How does thinking about other people help your analysis?

#### How do you structure your analyses?

#### What kind of polish do you do in the final version?

#### How do you handle people asking for adjustments to an analysis?

### Summary
- Analyses are generally a 1 time output that focus on a single takeway
- Reports are recurring and focus more on charts, and numbers
- Properties of Good Analyses:
	- directly answers the original question — or indicates there is not enough data
	- are completed quickly/timely while the data and the need is still fresh and relevant
	- is shareable and is self contained
	- can be explained on its own (doesn't refer to other work) and includes all necessary context
	- can be revisited in the future
- ==Must convert the business question into a DS questions, answer the DS question and turn it into a business response==
	- find the motive behind the question — make sure someone isn't just curious
	- find the question
	- find what decision will be made
	- ==do we have the required data?==
	- have a kickoff meeting
	- 
- When answering a simple business question — the goal is to answer the question in a way the stakeholder will understand
	- not create the highest tuned model
	- more complicated methods are harder to setup, debug, maintain and explain
	- choose the simplest method, it's easiest to trust
	- instead of pruning outliers, take the Log Transformation or the median instead of the mean
- Check in with stakeholder to ensure you're still on the right analysis track
	- maintain a continual level of polish in your notebook so it's readily shareable
- Create an Analysis Plan (guardrail to ensure you're doing relevant work)
	- write down everything you plan to do with the data
	- as you're working, track and make sure you stick to the plan
	- make the plan actionable with specific steps as opposed to "figure out xyz data aspect"
	- we strongly recommend using the following template:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240211160726.png]]
		- **The top** List the title of the analysis, who you are (in case the analysis will be shared with others), and the objective of the analysis.
		- **Sections:** Each section should be a general topic in the analysis. The analysis work done within each section should be self-contained (not relying on the work of other sections), so it should be possible for a different person to do each section. Each section should have a list of tasks.
		- First level of section lists The first level of the section lists should be each question that was posed. This section will help everyone remember why you’re doing that specific work, and if all the questions are successfully answered, the topic of the main section should be considered to be understood.
		- **Second level of section lists** The second level of the lists should have the actual tasks to do that can be checked off as the work is being done. These tasks could be types of models to run, for example, and the descriptions should be specific enough so that at any time, you could concretely say whether the work has been completed.
- Deliver analysis in person
	- discuss what you did, learned and chose not to look into
	- be prepared for questions and skepticisms (this data doesn't align w/ expectations or other report/data)
	- it's OK to say you need to look into something and don't know something
	- as a DS, you'll have the best chance of know what "followup analysis" will be valuable
- ==Before moving onto the next project, document your work==
	- double check that you can easily re-run the entire analysis
	- comment code as a refresher
	- add a README file (cover what analysis is, why it was done and how to run it)
	- store the code in Github
	- ensure the data is retained and stored in DB's and not on laptop
	- export the output for archival
- Read your audience while you're presenting — scale back on the fly when needed
- Don't make complicated visuals, consumers can't digest quickly
- Keep a clean notebook (w/o comments) that shows only the outcome when presenting
	- have an appendix to show where the analysis started
	- focus on the final format when writing the code
	- use your companie's color branding when it makes sense
- Your value add as a DS is to help stakeholder frame the problem

#### What does “machine learning engineer” mean on your team?

#### What was it like to deploy your first piece of code?

#### If you have things go wrong in production, what happens?

#### What’s your final piece of advice for data scientists working with engineers?

### Summary
- production models need a way of retraining and knowing when they're no longer performing well
	- need observability and maintainability
- typically publish model as API endpoint
- add error handling and input validation and sanitization and reduce downtime or startup time
- add tests
- keep in mind for realtime model outputs, there may be a lag between time when data is created, put into database and available for model consumption
	- consider what data will be needed in realtime when the model is run — will the data be fresh and readily available
- consider downstream consumers of model and how the model's correctness will (or will not) affect the data trust and reputation of business
	- the margin for error can be different between internal stakeholder analysis and external consumers/customers
- use the simplest model possible to make it easier to understand and debug
	- there are more important things than model accuracy
- perform load testing on API endpoint
- you can retrain the system on a schedule and alert if the new model is worse than the old one
	- ==don't build a monitor and allow it to run untrained and unmonitored overtime==
- expect stakeholders to ask for (sometimes needless) model changes — push back if the ROI on the change isn't there
- ML Engineer engineers DS model into software
- Be aware that your "POC" code may be deployed to production — choose your language and technology wisely
	- understand tradeoffs of highly complex models — determine what really solves the business problem
	- think about the problems that engineers have or will have when running your code

### 12.5 Interview with Sade Snowden-Akintunde, data scientist at Etsy

#### Why is managing stakeholders important?

#### How did you learn to manage stakeholders?

#### Was there a time where you had difficulty with a stakeholder?

#### What do junior data scientists frequently get wrong?

#### Do you always try to explain the technical # part of the data science?

#### What’s your final piece of advice for junior or aspiring data scientists?

### Summary
- work that may be/seem important for a stakeholder may not be important for the business as a whole
- what you work on heavily works on influences the business — this may constrain you
- Trying to fulfill every request is unsustainable, however, because the requests for answers are endless.
- When you’re considering possible tasks to work on, it helps to focus on two questions:
	- **_Will this work have an impact?_** Does knowing the result of this analysis materially affect the company? Would any result change decisions? Would this machine learning model increase profit?
	- **_Will this work do something new?_** Would you be applying an existing process over and over, or would you be trying something different?
- The answers to these two questions create four combinations of types of work:
	- Innovative and impactful
	- Not innovative but impactful
	- Innovative but not impactful
	- Neither innovative nor impactful
- To exist, these projects need to have many things going for them (The set of problems at a company that fall into all those buckets is exceedingly small.):
	- There needs to be enough data for data science methods to be useful.
	- There has to be an interesting signal in the data that the models can pick up.
	- The part of the business has to be large or important enough that changes can make a difference to the bottom line (so the project probably isn’t optimizing dry-erase marker inventory for the office).
	- The problem must be complex or unique enough that people haven’t tried it before.
- ==At the end of the day, the job of a data scientist is to provide value to the company, not to do the work that’s most fascinating to them==
- As a data scientist, it’s easy to feel that when you complete a project, people will be able to find a use for it. In practice, if you can’t see a use for the project immediately, stakeholders probably won’t either.
- ==it’s your responsibility as a data scientist to try to advocate for your time being well used.==
- The more you can align your project with what the stakeholder is asking for, the less likely the project will be to fail.
- Sam Barrows, data scientist at Airbnb: Turning requests into dialogues
	- One valuable tool for working with stakeholders is to turn requests into dialogues. You may often have colleagues ask you to complete specific tasks. Rather than immediately accept or reject these requests, start a dialogue about why the request is being made. What business need does the request aim to solve? Is there a better way to achieve the intended outcome? By understanding the motivations behind the requests that you receive, you are more likely to do meaningful work.
	- This strategy is practicing interest-based negotiation, where the players in a negotiation focus on addressing their underlying interests, rather than just their more immediate needs. In this case, the immediate needs are the requests that you receive, while the underlying interests are the business motivations behind these requests, as well as the objectives of the data science team.
- ==Managing stakeholders is probably one of the most important aspects of data science==
- I think the biggest thing that I’ve learned is it’s really important to communicate early and repeat yourself to make sure that people understand what you’re saying. Early in my data science career, I assumed that if I said something once and somebody agreed, then they knew exactly what I was talking about, but people may not even know that they don’t understand what you’re saying.
- I should have been working with the stakeholders from the very beginning to communicate how I could best analyze their work and what they would get from their experiment with proper design. I realized I have to actually say something from the very beginning if I want to be able to do my best work at the end.
- I think junior data scientists assume people are going to automatically recognize the value in their work. The way that you communicate is what gets people to recognize the value of your work.
- I think that people tend to want to go into technical careers like data science because they think that you can focus only on the logical element and not deal with the human element.

# Part 4: Growing in your data science role

## 13 When your data science project fails

### 13.1 Why data science projects fail

#### 13.1.1 The data isn’t what you wanted

#### 13.1.2 The data doesn’t have a signal

#### 13.1.3 The customer didn’t end up wanting it


### 13.2 Managing risk


### 13.3 What you can do when your projects fail

#### 13.3.1 What to do with the project

#### 13.3.2 Handling negative emotions


### 13.4 Interview with Michelle Keim, head of data science and machine learning at Pluralsight

#### When was a time you experienced a failure in your career?

#### Are there red flags you can see before a project starts?

#### How does the way a failure is handled differ between companies?

#### How can you tell if a project you’re on is failing?

#### How can you get over a fear of failing?

### Summary
- we define a project as a _failure_ when it doesn’t meet its objective. Projects can fail in many ways
	- the project might fail when it doesn’t help the stakeholder answer the business question.
	- For a machine learning problem, a project could fail when it isn’t deployed or doesn’t work when deployed.
	- The data isn’t what you wanted
	- The data doesn’t have a signal
	- The customer didn’t end up wanting it - No matter how accurate a model or analysis is, what matters is that it provides value to the stakeholder.
- data science is research and development.
	- Every day, data scientists take data that has never been analyzed before and search for a trend that may or may not be there.
	- Data scientists set out to build machine learning models on data where there may not be a signal.
	- It’s impossible for these tasks to always succeed, because new trends and signals are very rarely found in any field
- When you pitch a project, you don’t always have access to the data or even a full understanding of what it is (a special problem in consulting, where you don’t get access to the data until the work for the project is sold). Further, the data may exist but have a critical flaw that renders it useless. The data might exist in a database table, but the customer IDs might be corrupted and unusable. There are so many ways a dataset could have problems that it’s extremely difficult to check them all before starting a project. For this reason, it’s common for data science projects to barely get past the launch phase. ==The faster you can get access to the data and explore it, the faster you can mitigate the risk of inadequate data.==
- ==If that isn’t feasible, the next-best scenario is having a project timeline designed around the possibility that the data will be poor. By having an early “go/no go” step in the project at which the stakeholders agree to reassess the project feasibility, there’s less of a chance that stakeholders will be surprised that the data could be bad.==
- When you can’t find a viable substitute, sometimes all you can do is start a separate project to begin collecting better data.
- The act of creating a machine learning model to make a prediction is testing the data to see whether it has a signal within it, and there very well may not be. In fact, in many situations, it would be more surprising for there to be a signal than for there not to be a signal.
- The data science team sets out to use statistical quality-control techniques on the sales data so that they can have alerts when revenue is so low that there must be a bug on the site. They have a list of days when bugs were detected and historic revenue data.
- An analysis may turn up nothing new or interesting, or a machine learning model may fail to have any results that are better than random chance.
- If you can’t seem to find the signal in the noise, you have a couple of possible ways out:
	- Reframe the problem.
	- Change the data source.
- ==Most often, if the simplest method cannot detect any signal, the more complex ones won’t be able to either.== Thus, it’s best to start with simple modeling methods to validate the feasibility of the project and then move to more-complex and time-consuming- ones rather than start with the complex ones and go simpler. Don’t get lost spending months building increasingly complicated models, hoping that just maybe the next one will be the one that saves the project.
- The universal guidance on creating products that customers will like is to spend lots of time talking to and working with customers. The more you understand their needs, their desires, and their problems, the more likely you are to make a product that they want. The fields of market research and user experience research are different ways of understanding the customer, through surveys and focus groups in market research or through user stories, personas, and testing in user experience research. Many other fields have come up with their own methods and have been using them for years.
- If you find yourself in the situation of having a product that doesn't seem to be landing, the single best thing you can do is talk to your customers. It’s never too late to talk to your customers.
- The first thing to do with a project that failed is assess what you can learn from it. Some important questions to ask yourself and the team are
	- Why did it fail? 
	- What could have been done to prevent the failure?
	- What did you learn about the data and the problem?
- Although cutting a project is hard, as it requires you to admit that it’s no longer worth the effort, it pays off in the long run.
- A data scientist should increase the amount of communication if the project is failing. By letting the stakeholders know that problems are occurring or that the project can no longer move forward, you’re being transparent with the stakeholders and inspiring trust. After helping them understand the project state, you can work together to decide the next steps.
- most data science projects fail because data science is inherently based on trying things that could never work.
- A better metaphor is that a data scientist is like a treasure hunter. A treasure hunter sets out looking for lost valuables, and if they’re lucky, they’ll find some! A novice treasure hunter may look for standard goods, but an experienced hunter finds the most legendary of treasure. A data scientist is much more like a treasure hunter; they seek out successful models, and once in a while, their models and analyses work! Although a senior data scientist may work on more complicated or tricky projects, everyone is continuously failing, and that’s just part of the job.
- I got pulled in to lead a project to build a set of customer retention models. I thought I had talked with all the right stakeholders and understood the business need, how the team worked, and why the models were necessary. We built the models but soon learned that there was no interest in them. The problem was we hadn’t sat down with the customer care agents who would actually be using the output; I had only ever talked to the leaders. We delivered a list of probabilities of whether a customer would leave, but the care agents didn’t know what to do with that. They needed to know what they should do when a customer is at risk of leaving, which is a very different problem than the one we had tackled. The biggest lesson learned for me was that you really have to get down into the weeds and understand the use case of the problem. What’s the problem being solved by the people who will use the output?
- The key is keeping your cycle short so that you have a chance to see red flags sooner; you need to bring feedback in at a frequent rate. It’s really important to have not only an understanding of where you want to go at the end of the day, but also what success looks like at different points along the way. That way, you can check your work against that, get feedback, and be able to pivot if necessary. Checkpoints let you quickly know when you’ve missed or misunderstood something and correct course, rather than learning that at the end and having to backtrack.
- ==You can’t know if you’re failing if you haven’t from the outset defined what success is. What are the objectives that you’re trying to attain, and what do checkpoints along the way towards that success look like?==
- No one expects perfection. What is expected is for you to be honest about what you don’t know and to keep learning by asking questions and looking for feedback.

### 14.6 Interview with Renee Teate, director of data science at HelioCampus

#### What are the main benefits of being on social media?

#### What would you say to people who say they don’t have the time to engage with the community?

#### Is there value in producing only a small amount of content?

#### Were you worried the first time you published a blog post or gave a talk?

### Summary
- Public work is an area in which the time you invest can pay back twice over.
- We see four main benefits of joining the broader data science community
	- Gaining skills
	- Growing your network
	- Gaining opportunities  — This is a large positive feedback loop: talks lead to more talks, and projects lead to more projects.
	- Giving back
- If you need to make the case for conferences to your manager, here are some benefits to focus on:
	- Recruiting — It costs thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to recruit a data scientist. One of the biggest problems is getting good candidates to apply in the first place. Huge tech companies such as Google and Amazon and hot startups may have great candidates knocking down their door, but most companies don’t have that name recognition. If you meet people at conferences, you put your company’s name out there.
	- Knowledge — Your manager wants to know what you’ll be able to do after a conference that you couldn’t do before. It’s even better if you share that knowledge with the team by writing an article (which can also become a blog post!) or presentation. Start by looking at the conference schedule and reporting to your manager the talks that will be immediately applicable to solving your problems. But keep in mind that conferences also have the hallway track: informal conversations happening outside the presentations. You may find someone there who has the solution to a problem you’re facing! Five or ten minutes of the right person’s time can pay for the cost of your ticket.
- Overall, the best strategy when requesting money from your company is to show how what you learn from the conference will help you realize business wins or impact.
- When you’re coming up with an abstract idea, a great way to start is to think about who you were three months, six months, or a year ago. What do you know now that you wish you knew then?
- You don’t need to be an expert in the field; in fact, people who’ve just learned something are often the best teachers. Those who learned something a long time ago forget what it was like to struggle and what misconceptions they had.

#### How do you know it’s time to start looking for a new job?

#### Have you ever started a job search and decided to stay instead?

#### Do you see people staying in the same job for too long?

#### Can you change jobs too quickly?

#### What’s your final piece of advice for aspiring and new data scientists?

### Summary
- What should signal that it’s time to look for a new job? Our biggest piece of advice is to make sure you’re always learning
- As you get more comfortable with the day-to-day aspects of your job, see what you can do to find ways to improve your nontechnical skills. See whether you can take charge of a team (or at least an intern) and work on your management ability. Although the work that the company needs you to do may be limiting, as you get experience in it, you can usually find more time to broaden your portfolio.
- An exciting thing about data science is that there’s always more to learn, but that fact also makes the work challenging. If you don’t grow, finding your next position will be harder. It’s also expected of a senior data scientist to have noticeably different skills from those of a junior data scientist, both in breadth and depth. 
- Knowing how well you're aligned with your manager’s goals requires knowing what your own career goals are. We’re not talking about a ten- or even five-year plan; in such a new and quickly developing field, it’s impossible to know what opportunities will be available that far in the future. But how do you want to spend the next few years?
- Leaving without another job is risky. The other part is that it’s easier to find a job when you’re currently employed. One reason for that is unfair prejudice among hiring managers against those who are unemployed. Another is that your negotiating position is weaker: whatever the new employer is offering will be more than you’re making, so it’s harder to ask for higher compensation. Yet another reason is that if you’ve taken months off, you may not have kept your skills up and could be rusty for technical interviews.
- If you do want to take time off, it’s hugely helpful to have a strong data science network: people who are familiar with your work and can get you in the door and talking to a hiring manager. You also want to plan for some time before interviewing to brush up on your technical skills. Overall, unless you’re in a toxic work environment, we recommend not leaving a job without having another one unless you have a plan for the possibly extensive time off between jobs that you’re excited about.
- The first step in your job search is making a list of what you’ve enjoyed in your current job. _Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life_, by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans (Knopf, 2016), suggests that for a week, you make a note before and after every activity about how much you thought you would enjoy it and how much you actually did. Do you hate having meetings for a couple hours each day, or do you actually like meetings because they bring structure to your day? If you’re in a distributed data science team, do you wish that you reported to a data science manager? You can use this list to design your search.
- When you’re considering your options, you have to protect your market value. Fairly or not, data scientist is still usually viewed as being a more prestigious title than data analyst, and a senior data analyst’s role may pay less than a data scientist’s. You’ll want to balance these considerations as you think about your next role.
- After you start applying to companies and getting interviews, you’ll have to answer the question “Why are you leaving your job?” 
- A good answer is that you’re looking for challenges. Another good strategy is to pretend that the question is “Why do you want to work for us?” If you imagine that, your answer will be positive (“I’ve heard amazing things about your machine-learning team and am eager to learn”). If you give a more specific answer, make sure that it fits the new employer. You don’t want to say “I’m looking for a team with senior data scientists I can work with” if the interviewing company doesn’t have any!
- Just because you are leaving your company doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be proud of the work you’ve done there. You should absolutely talk about projects that you’ve worked on or skills you’ve learned.
- A fine nonspecific answer is “I created a chatbot in Python that generated responses to frequent client questions, decreasing the average time a customer service representative needed to spend with each client by five minutes and increasing customer satisfaction by 20%.” ==On the other hand, if you work at a private company, “I conducted A/B tests that brought the company’s total revenue from $20 million to $23 million” is a bad answer, as you’re disclosing private financial information.==
- ==If you don’t know something in an interview, don’t be afraid to admit it. You can say that you haven’t found a chance to use it or that you hope to learn more about it, but it hasn’t been a part of your job yet.== Suppose that you’re quizzed on machine learning algorithms, but you’ve been working on statistical modeling, SQL, data cleaning, and working with stakeholders, because the data is on such a scale that machine learning is done by dedicated machine learning engineers. You can show the work you’ve done, and if you’ve studied a particular topic before, even if you haven’t been using that knowledge recently, you’ll be able to get up to speed more quickly. ==It’s always better to demonstrate willingness to learn than to try to fake your way through.==
- It’s possible that during your job search, you realize that the grass is not always greener on the other side. In other words, you’re not finding anything you’d rather do than your current job, or everything pays much less and offers worse benefits, or the jobs won’t give you the flexibility you currently enjoy. It’s OK to decide to call off your job search! It wasn’t a waste of time if it gave you a newfound appreciation of your current job.
- Your boss should be the first person to know that you’ve leaving. Schedule a meeting with them (call it “career discussion,” not “my two weeks’ notice”), or use your weekly one-on-one time. You want to give notice in person if you’re co-located with them or by phone or video call if you’re not; don’t give notice by email. Start the conversation by expressing gratitude for how they’ve helped you and the opportunities you had at the company. Assure them that you’ll do all you can to help with the transition; you can list a few ideas you have, such as commenting your code or suggesting someone to take over a share of your work, but figuring that out will require collaboration with your manager.
- Talk to your manager about how they would like to let the rest of the team know. They may ask you to wait a few days while they figure out a transition plan so that they can share that information with the team when you tell them you’re leaving.
- One mistake to avoid is scheduling meetings with people before talking to your manager, even if you schedule those meetings for after your manager conversation. If your co-workers become suspicious about why you suddenly want to meet with them and ask whether it’s because you’re leaving, it will be really awkward: you’ll either have to lie or tell them before your manager knows.
- Most people will ask why you’re leaving. Make sure that you have something to say, and try to keep it positive, focusing on the new opportunity and what you’re grateful for at your current company.
- The best way to leave on a good note is to make the transition as easy as possible. You may not be able to find a replacement, but you can set the team up for success while they’re backfilling the role (if they choose to). Make a transition document for your manager, listing your responsibilities, which ones you can wrap up, which ones need to be transferred (and suggestions about who could pick it up), and which ones will have to wait until someone new is in the role. Beyond informing the person who’s taking over that project, you may need to make introductions to outside partners or clients, or let them know that you will not be handling the project any longer.
- The worst thing you can do is forget that you are the only person who knows how to do x at the company and leave it unassigned. If you do, you may get frantic calls and emails about how to do the work while you are trying to adjust to your new job. Forgetting that you own the only password to a particular system is a good way to get into trouble even after leaving.
- Have you ever started a job search and decided to stay instead?
	- All the time. When I’m looking at other roles, I may identify things I could actually be doing at my current company. It’s kind of a kick to go out and find those opportunities as opposed to waiting for somebody to give them to me. This fits into my broader philosophy that your current job responsibilities should be a conversation you’re having with your manager. For the engineers I manage, I try to have open and honest conversations where they let me know what opportunities they’re looking for. I can then figure out whether that exists within the current team or, if not, whether we can find them a 20% project outside of our team. 
- nobody else is going to execute your job exactly like you do, but that doesn’t mean that no one else can do it.
- I want to see experienced people having larger kinds of impact and change. If you see a problem, you should think about addressing it in a way that scales, is repeatable, and solves an organizational problem, not just something that is a one-off fix.

### 16.5 Interview with Angela Bassa, head of data science, data engineering, and machine learning at iRobot

#### What’s the day-to-day life as a manager like?

#### What are the signs you should move on from being an independent contributor?

#### Do you have to eventually transition out of being an independent contributor?

#### What advice do you have for someone who wants to be a technical lead but isn’t quite ready for it?

#### What’s your final piece of advice to aspiring and junior data scientist?

### Summary
- three common career trajectories for a data scientist—moving into management, becoming a technical leader, and switching to independent consulting
- high-level guide to the different expectations for levels of data scientists:
	- **Junior data scientist**
	    - A person who can complete a data science task given clear direction on what that task should be. If told to use a clustering algorithm to segment new customers by their purchasing attributes, a junior data scientist should be able to do this with guidance from a manager. If technical problems occur, such as bugs in code or data systems not connecting, they may need to consult other team members to solve them.
	- **Senior data scientist** 
	    - A person who can not only complete a data science task, but also figure out what other tasks are needed. They not only could do the example segmentation through clustering (described earlier), but also would realize things like the fact that the same algorithm could be used for existing customers too (and then do that). They’re skilled at solving technical issues and are the people who are brought in when others have problems.
	- **Above senior data scientist**
	    - At levels higher than senior data scientist, the role becomes more about helping others. Thus, a person usually moves beyond senior data scientist when they are consistently mentoring others, creating strategies, and seeing the bigger picture.
- A manager is a person who is responsible for a team of people successfully performing their objectives. These five basic tasks are usually, but not always, the job of a data science manager:
    - **Determining the team’s work** — This work can be done at a strategic level, such as deciding what large projects should be taken on. It can also be done at a more tactical level, such as deciding what features should be included in a product.
    - **Determining who should be on the team** — A manager usually chooses who to hire and who to let go, with the approval of human resources and other parties. They coordinate the interview process and weigh in during it.
    - **Mentoring team members** — Everyone on a team has unique challenges to work through, and a manager helps them meet those challenges. A manager regularly checks in on each person and provides advice and recommendations to help them solve their problems.
    - **Resolving team issues** — If the team is having issues that prevent work from being done (for example, if another team is unwilling to provide necessary access to data), it’s the job of the manager to find a solution so that the team can continue.
    - **Managing projects** — A manager has to keep track of the work going on within the team and ensure that things are on schedule. Although many teams have a project manager specifically assigned to this task, the manager still needs to maintain oversight of the work.
- A manager has to communicate continuously with people inside and outside their team. They need to be aware of how team members are doing, how projects are doing, and what is on the horizon.
- If you like teaching and helping others, management is a great role for you. Much of your job is helping people on your team succeed by working with them, teaching them what you’ve learned in your career, and helping them with their struggles. A great manager is like a business therapist: they sit down with a person for 60 minutes and help them work through their problems.
- Having to keep a positive attitude about work you don’t agree with for the benefit of the people on your team can be extremely frustrating. If you let the people below you feel your frustrations, you may lower their job satisfaction.
- Being a manager gives you a lot more things to worry about. You have to worry about your own performance, just as you did when you were an individual contributor, but you also have to worry about the performance of the rest of your team. You have to worry about their career satisfaction, and you have to worry about what’s happening politically at levels above you. You have to worry whether the team will have funding and whether a project that’s going too slowly will be canceled. Having this many worries, most of them not directly in your control, can be extremely stressful for people with certain personality types. If you have trouble not taking work home, management may not be for you.
- If you are an independent contributor and want to be a manager, you need to find opportunities to develop and practice leadership skills. These skills include working well with others, both more junior and senior than you, seeing the bigger picture, and managing a timeline for a project.
- ==a manager has to enable their team to make decisions==
- A principal data scientist (or staff, chief, data scientist V, technical lead, or other title, depending on the company) is a person in an organization whose job is to be an expert in data science and help others with technical tasks. being a principal data scientist allows you to do more and more of it. But instead of doing data science on your own (although you’ll do plenty of that), you’ll also be tasked with helping other data scientists with their jobs.
- A principal data scientist job involves multiple responsibilities:
    - **Influencing data science strategy**— A principal data scientist has to lay out the plan for tackling data science problems. Is modeling payment fraud feasible? Should a neural network be used? ==The manager is responsible for the idea and business plan; the principal is on the hook for how it should work.==
    - **Mentoring junior data scientists**— Because a principal data scientist has so much experience, it’s their obligation to share what they know with more-junior employees. Their growth is as important as the principal data scientists’ own work.
    - **Finding solutions to difficult problems** — ==When the data science team is plagued by a difficult technical problem, the principal data scientist is the person who’s on the hook to devise a solution—or declare it impossible to solve.==
- Although the work of a principal data scientist is related to data science, it’s rare for a principal to do individual-contributor work such as making a single analysis or creating a machine learning model. Those tasks require a lot of time and unified focus, and a principal data scientist has to split their work across many projects and areas. Data science projects tend to fall on junior and senior data scientists, although the principal coordinates and oversees them.
- If your manager is telling you that they think you’re ready and want to advocate for you in the promotion process, try to give them as much documentation as possible about what you’ve been doing and why you’re capable of taking the new job.
- There are plenty of occasions when people are so used to seeing someone in a particular role that they’re unwilling to risk putting that person in a new one. By changing companies, you’ll get to work with a group of people who don’t have expectations about what you can do and may give you more opportunities.
- junior data scientists don’t always get to devise a data science approach, execute it, and see the results themselves without having someone else make key decisions about it.
- The biggest problem with being a principal data scientist is that you won’t have someone to turn to for help when you’re stuck.
- It’s easy to fall into the habit of working more hours than you should and still not feeling like you’ve done enough. Because so many people rely on you, having only a 40-hour work week or weeklong vacations without your laptop are a lot harder to pull off. If you want a nice, relaxing job, principal data scientist probably isn’t it.
- Unfortunately, many senior data scientists struggle to get promoted to the next level. To be qualified to be a principal data scientist, you need to be a strong-enough data scientist to work independently effectively and to lead others. Then you need to draw attention to your abilities and contributions, and find other people in the company to champion you so that you’re well-known as a critical part of the team.
- ==To work independently as a data scientist, you need to be able to handle full projects without outside guidance. If your manager gives you a task such as “Create an analysis on where we should place our next retail store,” they need to be able to trust that you can do the work without the help of others and without getting stuck and not telling anyone. As you grow as a data scientist, the ability to work independently should come somewhat naturally as you become more practiced in the work. To speed this growth, try to pay attention to when you get stuck and what you do in those situations. If you ask for help, what does that help provide that you couldn’t do on your own? The more you can maximize the times when you can solve the problem yourself, the better.==
- ==As you gain experience, you should also pay attention to the data scientists around you. The more opportunities you can find for technical mentorship, the stronger you’ll be at helping others—which is great for a principal role.==
- It’s easy to rely on other data scientists to formulate an approach, but it’s hard to be a principal data scientist without this skill.
- As an independent consultant, you have to be an entire company, which means that you have to do many different things, such as
	- **_Marketing your business—_** You won’t be able to get new clients for your company unless people know about you. That may mean going to conferences, having meetings with old colleagues, or creating promotional materials such as blog posts.
	- **_Doing sales—_** When you find a company that’s interested in hiring your company for a data science project, you’ll need to meet with people from that company and make a proposal for the work. If you can’t get them interested in this proposal, you won’t get the work.
	- **_Executing the project—_** This work is the data science work you were hired for. It also includes project management to keep things on track and deal with any situations that may arise (such as bad data).
	- **_Delivering the results—_** When you’ve created the model or done the analysis, you need to present what you’ve done to the client and get them on board with it. If they like it, you may get a follow-on project, and if they don’t, you may lose them as a client.
	- **_Managing the business—_** Businesses need to do things like pay taxes, create legal documents, keep track of accounts and cash flow, and perform lots of other small tasks that add up over time.
