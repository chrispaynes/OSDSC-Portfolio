The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a ==statistical test used to assess the stationarity of a time series==. Developed by economists David Dickey and Wayne Fuller, the test is an extension of the Dickey-Fuller test and is commonly employed in econometrics and time series analysis. ==Stationarity is a crucial concept in time series modeling, as many statistical methods assume that the underlying data has a constant mean and variance over time.==

==The ADF test examines the **null hypothesis** that a unit root is present in the time series data, indicating non-stationarity.==

==The **alternative hypothesis** is that the time series is stationary after accounting for a possible unit root. ==

==The ADF test involves estimating the autoregressive model of the time series and assessing whether the coefficient on the lagged term is significantly different from 1.==

==If the coefficient is significantly less than 1, the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is rejected in favor of stationarity.==

==The ADF test is widely used in practice to determine whether differencing or other transformations are necessary to make a time series stationary. ==

Stationary time series are easier to model and analyze, making the ADF test a valuable tool in the pre-processing stage of time series analysis and forecasting.
