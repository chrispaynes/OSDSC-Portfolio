==White noise in the context of time series analysis refers to a special type of random signal where data points are independent and identically distributed with a constant mean and variance. In simpler terms, white noise is characterized by random fluctuations that exhibit no discernible pattern or correlation over time. The term "white" is used to signify that the signal covers the entire frequency spectrum, implying equal intensity at all frequencies.==

==Key characteristics of white noise include its unpredictability, lack of trend or seasonality, and constant variance. Each observation in a white noise time series is considered to be unrelated to previous or subsequent observations, making it a series of uncorrelated random variables. The absence of patterns and structure in white noise makes it a useful benchmark in time series analysis, helping analysts distinguish between random fluctuations and meaningful patterns in real-world data.==

==In a time series plot of white noise, one would typically observe a sequence of seemingly random and unpredictable data points, often resembling a "noisy" or static-like pattern. White noise serves as a baseline for comparison when assessing whether observed patterns in a given time series are statistically significant or if they can be attributed to random chance. Time series models often assume that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are white noise, indicating that any remaining patterns in the data have been captured by the model.==

- The presence of white noise tells you if you should further optimize the model or not.
- White noise is a series that’s not predictable, as it’s a sequence of random numbers. If you build a model and its residuals (the difference between predicted and actual) values look like white noise, then you know you did everything to make the model as good as possible. On the opposite side, there’s a better model for your dataset if there are visible patterns in the residuals.

- The following conditions must be satisfied for a time series to be classified as white noise:
	- The average value (mean) is zero
	- Standard deviation is constant — it doesn’t change over time
	- The correlation between time series and its lagged version is not significant

- There are three (easy) ways to test if time series resembles white noise:
	- By plotting the time series
	- By comparing mean and standard deviation over time
	- By examining autocorrelation plots
