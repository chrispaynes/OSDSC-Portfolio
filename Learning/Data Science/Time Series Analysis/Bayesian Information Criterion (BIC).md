The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as the Schwarz criterion, is ==a statistical criterion used in model selection and evaluation. It is a criterion for comparing different statistical models and aims to balance the goodness of fit with the complexity of the model, penalizing overly complex models. ==

==The BIC is a variant of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and is particularly useful when dealing with a limited sample size.==

The formula for BIC is given by:

$\text{BIC} = -2 \cdot \ln(\hat{L}) + k \cdot \ln(n)$

Here, $\hat{L}$ is the maximized likelihood of the model, $k$ is the number of parameters in the model, and $n$ is the sample size. 

==The BIC penalizes models with more parameters more severely than the AIC does. The goal is to choose the model with the lowest BIC value, indicating a good compromise between model fit and complexity.==

In practical terms, ==when comparing different models using BIC, the model with the lowest BIC is considered to be the most appropriate, provided that the underlying assumptions are met.==

BIC is widely used in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and econometrics for selecting models that effectively balance accuracy and simplicity.
