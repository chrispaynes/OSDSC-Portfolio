The Mean Forecast Error (MFE) is a ==metric used to quantify the average difference between predicted values and actual values in a time series forecasting model. It provides a measure of the bias in the forecasts, indicating whether the model tends to systematically overestimate or underestimate the actual values.==

The formula for Mean Forecast Error (MFE) is:

$MFE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} (Y_t - \hat{Y}_t)}{n}$

where:
- $Y_t$ is the actual value at time $t$,
- $\hat{Y}_t$ is the predicted value at time $t$,
- $n$ is the total number of observations.

==The MFE can be positive or negative, and its sign indicates the direction of bias:==
- ==If MFE > 0, the model tends to overestimate the actual values.==
- ==If MFE < 0, the model tends to underestimate the actual values.==

==It's important to note that the MFE does not account for the magnitude of errors; it only provides information about the average direction of bias. Therefore, while MFE is a useful indicator of bias, it may not capture the full picture of forecasting accuracy.==

==Analyzing the MFE alongside other metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or percentage-based metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) can offer a more comprehensive assessment of the forecasting model's performance, considering both bias and precision.==
