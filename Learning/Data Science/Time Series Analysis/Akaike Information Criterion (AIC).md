The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a statistical measure used for model selection among a set of candidate models.

It ==provides a trade-off between the goodness of fit of a model and its complexity==, aiming to balance the desire for a model to explain the data well with the need to avoid overly complex models that may overfit the data. AIC was developed by the Japanese statistician Hirotugu Akaike.

The AIC is calculated using the formula: $AIC = 2k - 2ln(L)$, where $k$ is the number of parameters in the model, and $ln(L)$ is the natural logarithm of the maximum likelihood of the model given the data.

==The AIC penalizes models with more parameters, encouraging the selection of simpler models when multiple models fit the data reasonably well.==

In the context of model selection, ==the goal is to choose the model with the lowest AIC value, as it suggests a good compromise between model fit and complexity.== A lower AIC indicates a model that explains the data well while using fewer parameters. AIC is commonly used in fields such as statistics, econometrics, and machine learning to guide the selection of models that balance accuracy and simplicity.
