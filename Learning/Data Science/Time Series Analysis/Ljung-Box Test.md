The Ljung-Box test, also known as the Ljung-Box Q test, is a ==statistical test used to assess whether there are significant autocorrelations in a time series at different lags. It is commonly employed in the field of time series analysis to check whether the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) from a model exhibit significant autocorrelation patterns.==

Here's a brief overview of how the Ljung-Box test works:

1. ==**Null Hypothesis (H0):** The null hypothesis of the Ljung-Box test assumes that there are no significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the time series.==

2. ==**Alternate Hypothesis (H1):** The alternative hypothesis suggests that there are significant autocorrelations in the residuals, indicating that the model has not adequately captured the temporal dependencies in the data.==

3. ==**Test Statistic Calculation:** The Ljung-Box test computes a test statistic, $Q$, which is based on the sum of squared autocorrelations of the residuals at various lags. The formula for the test statistic is a function of the sample size and the autocorrelations at different lags.==

4. ==**Critical Values:** The calculated Q statistic is then compared to critical values from the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of lags being tested. If the Q statistic exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.==

In summary, the Ljung-Box test is a ==diagnostic tool used to assess the adequacy of a time series model by examining whether the residuals exhibit significant autocorrelation beyond chance==. A rejection of the null hypothesis suggests that there are remaining patterns in the residuals that the model has not captured. This test is often used in combination with other diagnostic checks to ensure the validity of time series models.
