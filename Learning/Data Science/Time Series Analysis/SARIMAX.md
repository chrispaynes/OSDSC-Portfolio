SARIMAX, which stands for **Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors**, is a powerful ==time series modeling technique that extends the capabilities of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model by incorporating additional components to account for seasonality and exogenous variables.==

Here's a breakdown of the components in SARIMAX:

1. **Seasonal (S) Component:**
   - SARIMAX ==includes seasonal components that account for repeating patterns or cycles in the time series data. These patterns might occur at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or yearly.==

2. **AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA) Components:**
   - Similar to ARIMA, ==SARIMAX includes autoregressive, integrated, and moving average components to model the temporal dependencies, trends, and random shocks in the data.==

3. **eXogenous (X) Factors:**
   - ==SARIMAX allows the inclusion of exogenous variables, which are external factors not determined by the time series itself. These variables can help improve the model's accuracy by incorporating additional information that influences the dependent variable.==

The SARIMAX model is denoted by $SARIMAX(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)$, where:
- $p, d, q$ are the order of the autoregressive, integrated, and moving average components.
- $P, D, Q$ are the order of the seasonal autoregressive, seasonal integrated, and seasonal moving average components.
- $s$ is the length of the seasonal cycle.

==SARIMAX is a flexible and widely used tool for time series forecasting and analysis, especially when dealing with data that exhibits both seasonality and external influences. The model parameters are typically determined through a combination of statistical methods and model selection techniques.==
