Forecast bias ==refers to the systematic tendency of a forecasting model to consistently overestimate or underestimate the actual values of a time series. In other words, it measures whether the model tends to predict values that are, on average, higher or lower than the observed values.== 

==Understanding forecast bias is crucial for assessing the accuracy and reliability of a forecasting model.==

==The forecast bias can be quantified by calculating the mean forecast error (MFE), which is the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values over a given time period==. The formula for MFE is as follows:

$MFE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} (Y_t - \hat{Y}_t)}{n}$

where:
- $Y_t$ is the actual value at time $t$,
- $\hat{Y}_t$ is the predicted value at time $t$,
- $n$ is the total number of observations.

The sign of the MFE indicates the direction of the bias:
- If MFE > 0, the model tends to overestimate.
- If MFE < 0, the model tends to underestimate.

While the MFE provides a measure of the average bias, it's essential to consider the magnitude and direction of bias at different points in the time series. Visualizing the residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) over time or plotting a time series of the forecast errors can help identify patterns and trends in forecast bias.

Addressing forecast bias is important because it can impact decision-making and lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Analysts may need to adjust the forecasting model, consider alternative approaches, or incorporate additional information to mitigate bias and improve the accuracy of predictions.
