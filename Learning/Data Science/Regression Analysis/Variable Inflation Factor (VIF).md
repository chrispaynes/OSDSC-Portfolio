Variance Inflation Factor is a ==measure used in regression analysis to assess the extent of multicollinearity among predictor variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, making it challenging to determine the individual effect of each variable on the dependent variable.==

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) ==quantifies how much the variance of the estimated regression coefficients is increased due to multicollinearity==.

The formula for VIF for a particular predictor variable is:

$VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}$

where:
- $VIF_i$ is the Variance Inflation Factor for the $i$-th predictor variable,
- $R_i^2$ is the $R^2$ value obtained by regressing the $i$-th predictor variable against all other predictor variables.

==A high VIF indicates a high degree of multicollinearity, suggesting that the variance of the estimated regression coefficients is inflated, and the associated standard errors may be unstable.==

Researchers and analysts ==use VIF as a diagnostic tool to identify and address multicollinearity issues in regression models. If VIF values are excessively high, it may be necessary to consider removing or transforming correlated variables to improve the stability and interpretability of the regression results.==
