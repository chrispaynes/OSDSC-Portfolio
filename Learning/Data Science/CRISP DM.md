# Overview
==CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is a widely used and well-established framework for guiding and managing data mining and machine learning projects. It provides a structured and systematic approach to the entire data mining process, from understanding the problem to deploying and maintaining the model. CRISP-DM was developed by a consortium of data mining experts and practitioners and is known for its flexibility and adaptability to different domains and industries.==

The CRISP-DM process consists of six major phases:

1. ==**Business Understanding**:==
   - In this initial phase, the primary focus is on understanding the business problem or the goal of the data mining project. This involves defining objectives, success criteria, and the overall scope of the project.
   - Key tasks include identifying business goals, assessing the situation, and defining the problem.

2. ==**Data Understanding**:==
   - Once the business problem is understood, the next step is to gather, explore, and understand the available data. This includes data collection, data exploration, and data profiling.
   - Key tasks include data collection, data description, data exploration, and data quality assessment.

3. ==**Data Preparation**:==
   - In this phase, data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and creating derived attributes.
   - Key tasks include data cleaning, data transformation, and feature engineering.

4. ==**Modeling**:==
   - The modeling phase is where machine learning and data mining techniques are applied to build and train predictive or descriptive models. Multiple algorithms may be tested and evaluated.
   - Key tasks include selecting modeling techniques, building models, and assessing model performance.

5. ==**Evaluation**:==
   - After building models, they are evaluated to determine their effectiveness in solving the business problem. Evaluation metrics are used to assess model performance, and models may be fine-tuned or adjusted based on the results.
   - Key tasks include model evaluation, model selection, and model validation.

6. ==**Deployment**:==
   - Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it is deployed into the operational environment to be used for making predictions or decisions. Deployment may involve integrating the model into a production system.
   - Key tasks include model deployment, monitoring model performance, and maintenance.

==CRISP-DM is iterative, meaning that it often involves going back and forth between phases as new insights are gained or as the project requirements change. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the importance of involving stakeholders and domain experts throughout the process to ensure that the results align with business goals.==

==CRISP-DM provides a structured and systematic approach to data mining and machine learning projects, helping organizations effectively harness the power of data to make informed decisions and solve complex problems.==

- "The map is not the territory"
	- Data is not always the situational truth â€” it is a fallible representation much like a map is fallible repr. of actual territory. If you crumple the map, damage the map or rewrite it, it doesn't mean the actual territory has changed
