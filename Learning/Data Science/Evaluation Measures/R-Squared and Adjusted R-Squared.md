R-Squared (R²) and Adjusted R-Squared are ==metrics used in regression analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model. They provide information about the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model==.

1. **R-Squared (R²):**
   - ==R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. It is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variability, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability.==
   - The formula for R-Squared is: $R² = 1 - \frac{\text{Sum of Squared Residuals}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares}}$
   - ==R-Squared is a relative measure and does not indicate the goodness of fit by itself. It is often used in conjunction with other metrics to assess the overall performance of the model.==

2. **Adjusted R-Squared:**
   - ==Adjusted R-Squared is an extension of R-Squared that penalizes the inclusion of additional independent variables that do not significantly contribute to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. It accounts for the number of predictors in the model and adjusts R-Squared accordingly.==
   - The formula for Adjusted R-Squared is: $\text{Adjusted R²} = 1 - \left(1 - R²\right) \times \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1}$
     where $n$ is the number of observations and $k$ is the number of independent variables.
   - ==Adjusted R-Squared tends to be lower than R-Squared when additional variables do not contribute significantly to the model.==

Key points:

- **Interpretation:**
  - R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values close to 1 indicate a good fit, meaning that a large proportion of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.
- **Comparison:**
  - Adjusted R-Squared is often preferred over R-Squared when comparing models with different numbers of predictors because it accounts for the potential overfitting associated with adding more variables.
- **Caution:**
  - ==Both R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared have limitations and should not be the sole criteria for model evaluation. It is important to consider other metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), in conjunction with R-Squared values.==

In summary, R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared are measures of how well a regression model fits the data, with Adjusted R-Squared providing a more conservative assessment that considers the complexity of the model.
