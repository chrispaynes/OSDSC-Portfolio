Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a ==metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a regression model. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.== MAE provides a straightforward and interpretable assessment of how well the model's predictions align with the observed data.

The formula for Mean Absolute Error is as follows:

$MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$

where:
- $n$ is the number of observations in the dataset.
- $y_i$ is the actual value of the target variable for the $i$-th observation.
- $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of the target variable for the $i$-th observation.
- The absolute differences between actual and predicted values are averaged.

Key points about MAE:

1. **Scale Interpretation:**
   - ==The MAE is in the same units as the target variable, making it easily interpretable in the context of the problem.==

2. **Robust to Outliers:**
   - ==Unlike the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), MAE is less sensitive to outliers because it doesn't involve squaring the differences.==

3. **Interpretability:**
   - ==Each absolute difference contributes equally to the overall MAE, providing a simple and intuitive measure of average prediction error.==

4. **Comparison with RMSE:**
   - ==MAE and RMSE are two commonly used metrics in regression analysis. MAE is often preferred when the absolute magnitude of errors is more critical, while RMSE is sensitive to large errors.==

5. **Use in Model Evaluation:**
   - MAE is frequently used during the training and evaluation of regression models to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

In summary, Mean Absolute Error is a straightforward metric that quantifies the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It is valuable for assessing the overall accuracy of a regression model in predicting continuous outcomes.
