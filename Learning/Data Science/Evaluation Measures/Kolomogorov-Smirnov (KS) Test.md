The Kolmogorov-Smirnov or KS test is a ==statistical test that assesses the goodness-of-fit between the observed cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a sample and a theoretical CDF. It is often used in statistical analysis to compare a sample distribution with a reference distribution.==

Here are key points about the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:

1. **Goodness-of-Fit Test:**
   - ==The primary purpose of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is to determine whether a sample follows a specified distribution. ==

2. **Two-Sample KS Test:**
   - ==The test can be applied as a two-sample test to compare two distributions. In this context, it assesses whether two samples come from the same underlying distribution.==

3. **KS Statistic:**
   - ==The KS test produces a statistic called the KS statistic, which represents the maximum vertical deviation between the observed and expected cumulative distribution functions.==

4. **Application in Model Evaluation:**
   - While the KS test itself is not commonly used in model evaluation, concepts related to cumulative distribution functions can be indirectly relevant. For example, in credit scoring, the KS statistic has been used to compare the cumulative distribution of predicted probabilities for good and bad credit outcomes.

In summary, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a statistical method for assessing the goodness-of-fit between observed and theoretical distributions.
