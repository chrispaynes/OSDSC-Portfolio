A monopartite network, also known as a unipartite network, is a type of network in network science where all nodes belong to a single set or class, and all connections or edges exist between nodes within that single set. In simpler terms, all nodes in a monopartite network are of the same type, and interactions or relationships occur only among nodes of that type.

Here are some key characteristics of monopartite networks:

1. **Single Node Type**: All nodes in the network are of the same type. There is no distinction between different classes or types of nodes.

2. **Edges Within the Same Set**: Edges or connections exist only between nodes within the same set. There are no edges connecting nodes from different sets.

3. **Homogeneous Structure**: The network has a homogeneous structure since all nodes share the same properties and relationships.

4. **Common Examples**:
   - Social Networks: A monopartite social network might represent connections between individuals where all nodes are individuals.
   - Biological Networks: In biological networks, nodes could represent proteins, genes, or metabolites, with edges representing interactions or relationships between them.

5. **Network Measures**:
   - Degree Distribution: Analysis of the degree distribution focuses on the connectivity patterns within the single set of nodes.
   - Clustering Coefficient: Measures the degree to which nodes in the network tend to cluster together.

Monopartite networks stand in contrast to bipartite networks, where nodes are divided into two distinct sets, and edges exist only between nodes in different sets. Bipartite networks are often used to model relationships between two different types of entities, such as users and items in recommendation systems.

Understanding the structure and properties of monopartite networks is fundamental to network analysis and provides insights into the patterns of connectivity and relationships within a single set of entities.
