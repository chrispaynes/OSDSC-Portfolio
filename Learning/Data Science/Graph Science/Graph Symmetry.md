==Graph symmetry refers to the properties of a graph that remain unchanged under certain transformations. In the context of graph theory, symmetry is closely related to the concept of automorphisms, which are isomorphisms from a graph to itself. An automorphism of a graph preserves the adjacency relationships between vertices.==

Here are some key aspects of graph symmetry:

1. **Automorphisms:**
   - An automorphism of a graph is a bijective function from the set of vertices to itself that preserves adjacency. In other words, if two vertices are adjacent in the original graph, their images under the automorphism are also adjacent.
   - Formally, for a graph G, an automorphism is a permutation π of the vertex set V(G) such that {u, v} is an edge in G if and only if {π(u), π(v)} is also an edge.

2. **Symmetric Graphs:**
   - A graph is considered symmetric if it has non-trivial automorphisms. Non-trivial means that there exists an automorphism that is not the identity permutation.
   - Complete graphs (where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge) are highly symmetric because any permutation of the vertices is an automorphism.

3. **Symmetry Groups:**
   - The set of all automorphisms of a graph forms a group, known as the symmetry group of the graph. This group captures the symmetries inherent in the graph's structure.
   - The order (size) of the symmetry group provides a measure of the graph's symmetry. A larger symmetry group indicates more symmetries.

4. **Graph Invariants:**
   - Symmetry in a graph is related to the existence of certain graph invariants that remain constant under automorphisms. For example, the chromatic number (minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices without adjacent vertices sharing the same color) is an invariant under graph automorphisms.

5. **Applications:**
   - Understanding graph symmetry has applications in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and network analysis. In chemistry, symmetric graphs can model molecular structures, and in physics, they may represent certain crystalline structures.

Graph symmetry is a rich area of study that connects graph theory with algebraic structures. Analyzing the symmetries of a graph can provide insights into its structural properties and help identify patterns or regularities within complex networks.
