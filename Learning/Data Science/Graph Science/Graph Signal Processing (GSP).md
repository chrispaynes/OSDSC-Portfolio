Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a field that combines concepts from graph theory and signal processing to analyze and process signals defined on graphs or networks. ==In traditional signal processing, signals are often represented as functions of time or space. In GSP, signals are associated with the nodes or edges of a graph, where the graph structure captures the relationships or interactions between different elements.==

Key concepts in Graph Signal Processing include:

1. **Graph Representation:** A graph is defined as a set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. The adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian matrix is often used to represent the relationships between nodes.

2. **Graph Signals:** These are ==signals defined on the nodes or edges of a graph. For example, in a social network, each person could be a node, and a signal might represent some attribute (e.g., age, opinion) associated with each person.==

3. ==**Graph Filters:** Analogous to traditional linear filters used in signal processing, graph filters are used to process graph signals. They capture the local interactions between neighboring nodes in the graph.==

4. **Graph Fourier Transform:** Similar to the Fourier transform in traditional signal processing, the Graph Fourier Transform represents a graph signal in a frequency domain associated with the graph.

Applications of Graph Signal Processing include:
- ==**Social Network Analysis:** Analyzing attributes or opinions of individuals in a social network.==
- **Sensor Networks:** Processing data collected from sensor nodes in a network.
- **Biological Networks:** Analyzing biological interactions represented as graphs.
- **Image and Video Processing on Graphs:** Representing images as graphs and applying signal processing techniques.

Graph Signal Processing provides a powerful framework for understanding and analyzing complex data structures that can be represented as graphs, and it extends the traditional signal processing methods to networked or relational data.
