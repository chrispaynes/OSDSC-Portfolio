A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph that consists of nodes connected by directed edges, where each edge has a specific direction from one node to another, and there are no cycles in the graph. In other words, a DAG is a directed graph that does not contain any directed cycles.

Key characteristics of a Directed Acyclic Graph:

1. **Directed Edges**: Each edge in a DAG has a direction, indicating a one-way relationship from one node (the tail of the arrow) to another (the head of the arrow).

2. **Acyclic Structure**: A DAG has no directed cycles, meaning there is no sequence of nodes and directed edges that form a closed loop. This acyclic property ensures that there is a clear directionality and no infinite sequence of nodes to traverse.

3. **Topological Ordering**: Due to the absence of cycles, a DAG can be topologically ordered, which means that the nodes can be linearly ordered in such a way that if there is a directed edge from node A to node B, then A comes before B in the order.

4. **Applications**: DAGs are used to represent various relationships and structures in different domains, including but not limited to:
   - Dependency relationships: Representing dependencies among tasks or events.
   - Hierarchical structures: Representing parent-child relationships in organizational charts or taxonomies.
   - Bayesian Networks: Representing probabilistic dependencies among variables.

5. **Directed Acyclic Graphs in Mathematics and Computer Science**: DAGs have applications in mathematics, computer science, and various fields. Algorithms for topological sorting and efficient traversals are commonly applied to DAGs.

6. **Directed Graphs with Cycles**: A graph that is not acyclic is referred to as a directed graph with cycles, and it may represent processes or relationships with feedback loops. However, DAGs are specifically characterized by their acyclic nature.

Example of a simple Directed Acyclic Graph:

```
   A --> B --> C
   |          |
   v          v
   D --> E --> F
```

In this example, there are directed edges from A to B, B to C, A to D, D to E, and E to F. The absence of cycles makes it a Directed Acyclic Graph.
