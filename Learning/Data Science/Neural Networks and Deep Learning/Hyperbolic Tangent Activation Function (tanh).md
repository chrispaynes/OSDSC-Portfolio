The hyperbolic tangent activation function, commonly referred to as tanh, is a popular activation function used in artificial neural networks. ==It is a type of sigmoid function== and is defined as:

$$\text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^{2x} - 1}{e^{2x} + 1}$$

In this equation:
- $\text{tanh}(x)$ is the output of the tanh function for a given input $x$.
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).

Key properties of the tanh activation function:

1. ==**Range**: The tanh function maps input values to the range of $(-1, 1)$. Unlike the sigmoid function, which maps to $(0, 1)$, tanh produces outputs in the symmetric interval, making it zero-centered.==

2. ==**Symmetry**: The tanh function is symmetric around the origin (0, 0). This means that for any input $x$, $\text{tanh}(-x) = -\text{tanh}(x)$.==

3. ==**Zero-Centered**: The zero-centered property of tanh can be advantageous for optimization algorithms in neural network training. It helps mitigate issues related to the vanishing gradient problem.==

4. **Non-Linearity**: Like the sigmoid function, tanh introduces non-linearity to the model. This non-linearity is crucial for the network's ability to learn complex relationships in the data.

==The tanh activation function is often used in hidden layers of neural networks, especially in scenarios where the data has zero-centered features. However, it's worth noting that tanh shares some characteristics with the sigmoid function, such as the potential for saturation and the vanishing gradient problem. In practice, alternatives like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and its variants are also commonly used, especially in deeper neural networks, due to their simplicity and effectiveness in addressing some of the challenges associated with tanh and sigmoid.==
