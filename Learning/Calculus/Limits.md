In calculus, a limit is a ==fundamental concept that describes the behavior of a function or a sequence as the input approaches a certain point. Limits are used to define derivatives, integrals, and other important concepts in calculus.== 

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a particular value $c$ is denoted by:

$\lim_{{x \to c}} f(x)$

If the values of $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to a single number as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $c$, then the limit exists and is equal to that number. This number is often referred to as the "limit value."

There are different types of limits, including:

1. **One-Sided Limits:**
   - $\lim_{{x \to c^+}} f(x)$ represents the limit as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right.
   - $\lim_{{x \to c^-}} f(x)$ represents the limit as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left.

2. **Infinite Limits:**
   - $\lim_{{x \to \infty}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{{x \to -\infty}} f(x)$ represent limits as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, respectively.

3. **Limits at Infinity:**
   - $\lim_{{x \to \infty}} f(x)$ and $\lim_{{x \to -\infty}} f(x)$ describe the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ becomes arbitrarily large or small.

4. **Limits of Sequences:**
   - $\lim_{{n \to \infty}} a_n$ represents the limit of a sequence as $n$ approaches infinity.

==The concept of limits is foundational for understanding continuity, derivatives, and integrals. For example, the derivative of a function at a point is defined as a limit, and the definite integral of a function over an interval involves limits as well. Limits play a crucial role in capturing the notion of approaching a value or a point of interest in a mathematical context.==
