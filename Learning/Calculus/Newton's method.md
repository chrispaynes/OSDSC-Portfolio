Newton's method, also known as Newton-Raphson method, is an ==iterative numerical technique for finding the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function.== It was developed by Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson in the 17th century. ==The method is widely used for solving equations where it may be difficult or impossible to find an algebraic solution.==

==The general idea behind Newton's method is to start with an initial guess for the root of the function and then refine that guess using the tangent line at the current estimate.== 

The iteration formula for Newton's method is given by:

$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$

Here:
- $x_n$ is the current approximation of the root,
- $f(x_n)$ is the value of the function at $x_n$,
- $f'(x_n)$ is the derivative of the function evaluated at $x_n$, and
- $x_{n+1}$ is the next approximation.

==The process is repeated iteratively until the difference between consecutive approximations becomes sufficiently small or until a specified level of precision is achieved.==

Key steps of Newton's method:
1. Choose an initial guess ($x_0$).
2. Apply the iteration formula to update the estimate ($x_{n+1}$).
3. Repeat the process until convergence.

==Newton's method is known for its rapid convergence near the root if the initial guess is reasonably close to the true root. However, it may exhibit divergence or converge to a different root if the initial guess is far from the true root or if certain conditions are not met.==

==The method is widely applied in various fields, including numerical analysis, optimization, and solving equations in physics, engineering, and other scientific disciplines.==
