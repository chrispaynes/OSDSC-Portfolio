Analytic Geometry, also known as coordinate geometry, is a ==branch of mathematics that combines algebra and geometry. It involves using algebraic techniques to study geometric shapes and their properties by representing them with coordinates. The Cartesian coordinate system, introduced by Ren√© Descartes, is a fundamental tool in analytic geometry.==

In the Cartesian coordinate system, points in a plane are represented by ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the point relative to two perpendicular axes. Lines, curves, and geometric figures can be described and analyzed using algebraic equations and inequalities.

Key concepts and techniques in analytic geometry include:

1. **Equations of Lines:**
   - The equation of a line in the plane can be represented in various forms, including slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), point-slope form ($y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$), and two-point form ($y - y_1 = \frac{{y_2 - y_1}}{{x_2 - x_1}}(x - x_1)$).

2. **Distance and Midpoint Formulas:**
   - The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the distance formula: $\sqrt{{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}}$.
   - The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the midpoint formula: $\left(\frac{{x_1 + x_2}}{2}, \frac{{y_1 + y_2}}{2}\right)$.

3. **Equations of Conic Sections:**
   - Conic sections, such as circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas, can be described by algebraic equations.

4. **Transformations:**
   - Geometric transformations, including translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, can be represented using coordinate geometry.

5. **Graphing Functions:**
   - Analytic geometry is used to graph functions and analyze their behavior.

Analytic geometry provides a powerful and systematic approach to studying geometry, allowing geometric problems to be translated into algebraic equations and solved using algebraic methods. It is a foundational topic in mathematics with applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and economics.
