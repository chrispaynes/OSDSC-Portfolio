The Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Cauchy Integral Formula are fundamental results in complex analysis, and they are associated with the behavior of holomorphic functions within closed contours in the complex plane.

### Cauchy Integral Theorem:

The Cauchy Integral Theorem states that if $f(z)$ is holomorphic (analytic) in a simply connected domain $D$ and $C$ is a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed contour lying in $D$, then the contour integral of $f(z)$ around $C$ is zero:

$\oint_C f(z) \, dz = 0$

This means that for a holomorphic function in a simply connected domain, the integral of the function around a closed curve is always zero.

### Cauchy Integral Formula:

The Cauchy Integral Formula provides a powerful expression for the value of a holomorphic function inside a contour in terms of its values on the contour itself. If $f(z)$ is holomorphic in a simply connected domain containing a closed contour $C$, and $a$ is any point inside $C$, then for all $z$ inside $C$, the value of $f(z)$ is given by:

$f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta - z} \, d\zeta$

In this formula:
- $f(z)$ is the holomorphic function,
- $C$ is a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed contour containing $a$,
- $z$ is a point inside $C$,
- The integral is taken over $C$.

The Cauchy Integral Formula is a powerful tool in complex analysis and is often used to compute integrals involving holomorphic functions. It relates the values of a holomorphic function inside a region to its values on the boundary of that region. It plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of complex functions and is foundational in complex analysis.
