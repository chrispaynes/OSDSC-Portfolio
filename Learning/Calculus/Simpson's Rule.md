Simpson's rule is a ==numerical integration technique used to estimate the definite integral of a function over a given interval. It provides an approximation to the area under a curve by dividing the interval into subintervals and fitting each pair of adjacent subintervals with a quadratic (second-degree) polynomial.==

==The formula for Simpson's rule is based on the idea of approximating the curve with a series of parabolas and then finding the area under these parabolas.== 

For a given function $f(x)$ and an interval $[a, b]$, the integral is approximated as:
$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \left[f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \cdots + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)\right]$
Here:
- $h$ is the width of each subinterval, given by $h = \frac{b - a}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of subintervals.
- $x_i$ represents the $i$-th point within the interval, with $x_0 = a$ and $x_n = b$.

==Simpson's rule is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule for approximating integrals because it takes into account the curvature of the function by fitting each pair of subintervals with a quadratic polynomial. It is particularly effective when dealing with smooth functions.==

==The accuracy of Simpson's rule improves as the number of subintervals increases. The rule is often applied in situations where an exact analytical solution is difficult to obtain, making it a useful numerical method for approximating definite integrals== in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computational mathematics.
