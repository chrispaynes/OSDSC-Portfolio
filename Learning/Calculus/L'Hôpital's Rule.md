L'Hôpital's Rule is a mathematical technique used to evaluate limits involving indeterminate forms. It is named after the French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital. The rule is particularly useful when trying to find the limit of a ratio of functions where both the numerator and denominator approach zero or infinity.

The indeterminate forms that L'Hôpital's Rule addresses are typically 0/0 or ±∞/±∞. The rule states that if the limit of the ratio of two functions f(x)/g(x) is of the form 0/0 or ±∞/±∞ as x approaches a certain point, and if the limit of the ratio of their derivatives f'(x)/g'(x) exists (or is ±∞) at the same point, then the limit of the original ratio f(x)/g(x) is the same as the limit of their derivatives.

Mathematically, if:

$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0} \text{ or } \frac{\infty}{\infty}$

and

$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

exists (or is ±∞), then:

$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

This rule can be applied successively if needed. It is particularly useful in calculus when dealing with limits involving rational functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions. Keep in mind that the prerequisites for applying L'Hôpital's Rule are that both the numerator and denominator must approach 0 or ±∞, and the limit of their derivatives must exist.
