In calculus, ==integrals are mathematical objects that represent the accumulation or total of a quantity over a given interval. They are used to compute the area under a curve, find the net accumulation of a quantity, and solve problems related to accumulation, such as finding displacement, total cost, or total mass.==

There are two main types of integrals:

1. **Definite Integral:**
   - The definite integral represents the signed area between the graph of a function and the x-axis over a specified interval $[a, b]$. It gives a numerical value, which can be interpreted as the net accumulation of the quantity represented by the function over the interval.
   - Mathematically, the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is denoted by $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$.

2. **Indefinite Integral:**
   - The indefinite integral represents a family of functions whose derivative is the original function. It is essentially the reverse process of differentiation. The result of an indefinite integral is expressed with a constant term, as the exact value of the constant is not specified.
   - Mathematically, the indefinite integral of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by $\int f(x) \, dx$.

==The process of finding integrals is known as integration. Common techniques for integration include basic rules (power rule, constant rule, etc.), substitution, integration by parts, and trigonometric integrals.==

==Integration has various applications, such as calculating areas, volumes, work done, and solving problems involving accumulated quantities.== 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a fundamental relationship between differentiation and integration, stating that if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$.
