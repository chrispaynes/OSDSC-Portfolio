In the context of economics and calculus, the equilibrium of supply and demand ==refers to the point where the quantity supplied by producers equals the quantity demanded by consumers. This equilibrium point is crucial in understanding the market dynamics and determining the market-clearing price.==

The equilibrium is typically represented graphically on a supply and demand diagram, where the supply and demand curves intersect. The supply curve represents the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to offer at different prices, while the demand curve represents the quantity that consumers are willing to buy at different prices.

==The equilibrium price (also known as the market-clearing price) is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. At this price, there is neither excess supply nor excess demand in the market. ==

==Mathematically, the equilibrium is the solution to the system of equations formed by the supply and demand functions.==

If $Q_s$ represents the quantity supplied as a function of price ($P$), and $Q_d$ represents the quantity demanded as a function of price, then the equilibrium is found where $Q_s(P) = Q_d(P)$. In mathematical terms, it can be expressed as:

$Q_s(P_{\text{equilibrium}}) = Q_d(P_{\text{equilibrium}})$

==Calculus is often used to analyze the behavior of supply and demand functions, determine the equilibrium point, and study the effects of changes in market conditions. The equilibrium concept is fundamental in microeconomics and plays a key role in analyzing market outcomes, prices, and resource allocations.==
