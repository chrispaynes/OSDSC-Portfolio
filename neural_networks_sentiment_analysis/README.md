# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks

### 1. Business Understanding

The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model using neural networks to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This can be applied to customer reviews, social media posts, and other text data to gain insights into public opinion and improve decision-making processes.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project consists of labeled text data, which includes various samples of text with corresponding sentiment labels.
- **Data Description**: The dataset contains columns such as `text` and `sentiment`, where `text` is the input feature and `sentiment` is the target label.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis includes understanding the distribution of sentiment classes, text length, and common words or phrases.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of noise such as HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
- **Data Transformation**: Tokenization and vectorization of text data using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection**: A neural network architecture is chosen for its ability to capture complex patterns in text data.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using the training dataset, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation and test datasets.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of model performance, including confusion matrix and error analysis.
- **Business Evaluation**: Assessment of how well the model meets the business objectives and its potential impact.

### 6. Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed as a web service or integrated into an application for real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring of model performance and updates as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.
